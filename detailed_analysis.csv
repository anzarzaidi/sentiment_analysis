What's the current status of crew? What support is being provided to the stranded crew? When will crew be allowed off the ship? The US Coast Guard has established a provisional, alternative route for ships partaking in the debris removal from the tragic fall of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore . This step is an integral element of a gradual strategy aimed at reinstating access to the main maritime pathway that serves the crucial port.The challenge of extracting steel and concrete debris at the collapse location is being tackled by dedicated teams.The authorities have designated the provisional passage mainly for the use of ships contributing to the debris clearance operations. Additionally, a number of barges and tugboats, which have been marooned in the Port of Baltimore since the disaster, are anticipated to navigate through this channel.As crews engage in the complex task of clearing the debris, the broader focus remains on the phased reopening of the main shipping channel, essential for the port's operation.The temporary channel, now operational, primarily serves vessels involved in the debris removal process. It also allows for the passage of some barges and tugs that have been stranded in the Port of Baltimore since the catastrophic event.Maryland governor Wes Moore emphasized the priority of recovering the remaining victims of the collapse, alongside the urgent need to reopen shipping channels. He highlighted the challenging nature of the recovery efforts, describing the wreckage as "chaotic."Efforts to lift significant portions of the bridge debris have been underway, with a large crane removing a 200-ton span, marking a critical step in the extensive recovery operation.The temporary channel has been specified to have a depth of 11 feet, with adequate horizontal and vertical clearances to accommodate marine traffic aiding in the cleanup effort.The container ship Dali remains stationary with its 21 crew members on board, engaged in maintaining the ship and cooperating with ongoing investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board and the US Coast Guard.Joshua Messick, serving as the executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, is among the limited number of individuals who have maintained communication with the crew.In discussions with the BBC, Messick revealed he has been in WhatsApp correspondence with the crew members following the organization of a care package delivery, which notably included WiFi hotspots.He portrayed the crew members as being "rattled" and notably reticent about their current circumstances as inquiries into the incident proceed."They're not saying much at all to anyone who has been in touch with them," Messick told BBC.He noted, "They didn't have WiFi until Saturday and they didn't really know what the perception of the rest of the world was. They weren't sure if they were being blamed, or demonised. They just didn't know what to expect."Messick further observed, "They are also in a very sensitive situation. What they can say can reflect on the company. I would imagine that they've been advised to keep a low-profile for the time being."The crew, consisting of 20 Indian nationals and one from Sri Lanka, has access to ample supplies, and their living quarters were not impacted by the collision. Efforts to support their well-being are ongoing, including care packages and mental health resources to address potential trauma and isolation.Officials have indicated that there are currently no intentions to have the crew of the Dali disembark. The crew remains engaged in the upkeep of the ship, and their departure is contingent upon the relocation of the vessel—a process that may be intricate and prolonged, the BBC report said.Crew members are required to possess appropriate visas and valid shore passes, which are necessary for disembarkation. Furthermore, they necessitate the accompaniment of escorts to transition from the ship to the terminal entrance, a role typically filled by various maritime-focused nonprofit organizations.The status of the necessary documentation for the Dali's crew to disembark remains uncertain, the BBC report added.The coordinated command managing the aftermath of the Baltimore incident communicated to the BBC on Monday that the duration of the ongoing investigation is yet to be determined and "until the process is complete, the crew will remain on board".(With inputs from agencies)|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108965405,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1354635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Otherwise, it was a quiet first night in prison for Kejriwal.Though prison officials described the incarcerated CM as "slightly uncomfortable" in the barracks at night, Kejriwal stuck to his usual routine even in jail.He didn't have the regular jail food but was given home-cooked food on the court orders plus his medicines. He woke up early to do some yoga and had the jail breakfast comprising bread and tea. He was then mostly seen walking around in the cell or reading a book. Guards are on alert after inputs suggested that some inmates could try to harm Kejriwal for "fame".Sources said that on Monday night, Kejriwal used only one shawl that he had brought from home, using the rest of the jail issued material for his bedding. From time to time, he paced around in his cell. A jail source said that prison doctors checked the AAP national convener's blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar level, which were normal. "He was given homemade lunch and then between 3.30pm and 6pm, he came out of his cell and walked, sat and did some reading," the source added.According to sources, Kejriwal also talked to his wife and one more family member through a video conference. He also met a lawyer in prison and signed some papers.Tihar's Jail No. 2 has a chequered past. In 2021, an inmate named Srikan Ramaswami was murdered there during a gang war that erupted in the complex. Ramaswami, a resident of Delhi's Ashok Vihar, had been arrested in a murder case in 2015. The prison authorities told the court that four undertrials beat the criminal with cricket bats around 7am on May 14. Police arrested the four suspects but the Court transferred the investigation of the murder to CBI. The Tihar administration had also recently recovered 33 mobile phones during surprise checks in jail.Another source added that the CM is lodged in the general ward, where petty criminals are also held, including those accused of thefts, domestic violence, pick pocketing and such crimes. There are also high-security wards in Jail No. 2 where gangsters from the Gogi and Tillu gangs and some militants are lodged. These wards are under heightened security and have heavy barricading.Terrorist Zia Ur Rehman is among the known notorious characters lodged in the jail, which has a population of around 600. The adjacent jail, No. 3, is known to hold dreaded criminals and several murders have been reported from there in the last few years. Last April, gangster Prince Tewatia was killed in an early-morning attack in that jail by rival gang members following an altercation with an inmate.The CM will be in jail for two weeks after being sent into judicial custody by a court on Monday in connection with a case related to the Delhi excise policy of 2021-22.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108986068,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1619512,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Additionally, two Maoists , carrying a combined reward of Rs 43 lakh, were killed in a night shootout in MP's Balaghat district, police confirmed Tuesday.The seizure of a light machine-gun, AK-47 rifles and several under-barrel grenade launchers in Bijapur suggests the presence of a high-ranking Maoist leader among those killed.According to police, the toll may rise as several other insurgents were wounded.Since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took office last Dec, a total of 47 Maoists have been killed in the state.Police sources attributed the success of the operation to accurate and timely technical intelligence. Authorities were alerted Monday evening about the movement of around 100 heavily armed Maoists in the Gangaloor region, a known insurgency hotspot near the Telangana border. Responding to the intelligence, a joint force comprising CoBRA commandos, CRPF, District Reserve Guards, and Special Task Force mobilised to intercept them.The shootout ensued around 6am Tuesday when security forces engaged the Maoists in the forests between Lendra and Korcholi villages in Gangaloor. The gunfight resulted in the recovery of the bodies of four Maoists initially, followed by six more and additional weaponry and Maoist material.The operation is ongoing, with further details expected as it progresses, Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI. "The slain Maoists will be identified after the bodies are brought to base," he said. They are believed to be from PLGA Company No 2. With heightened security operations ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, 22 Maoists have been eliminated in the fortnight since the announcement of election dates. Deputy CM Vijay Sharma expressed concern over the recovery of automatic weapons, highlighting the need for further investigation into their source.In MP, a gunfight broke out around 9pm Monday in Kerajhari forest of Balaghat district, situated near the border with Chhattisgarh, and continued for over two hours. Upon conducting a search of the area early Tuesday, police discovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist divisional committee member Sajanti, also known as Kranti, and area committee member Raghu, alias Sher Singh, aged 54. Both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounties announced by police in three states - MP, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

However, passengers whose flights have been cancelled or delayed have learnt that these norms do not address some of their core concerns.For instance: For a flight cancellation done within 24 hours of departure, the norms state that the airline should either provide an alternative flight or refund the ticket and pay compensation ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, depending on the length of the journey.For passengers who are not accommodated on an alternative flight, this compensation amount hardly covers the costs they would have to incur in buying a last-minute ticket to their destination.On Tuesday, Sushil Patni and his wife, both senior citizens, ended up spending Rs 21,000 to book tickets on IndiGo to fly to Delhi from Indore after Vistara cancelled their flight. They were booked on an evening departure to Baku and so could not wait for a day for alternative arrangements. Under the said norms, together they would get a compensation of Rs 15,000.Then again, the provisions mention free hotel accommodation only in case of flight delay, and not for cancellations. It states that the airline is required to provide meals and refreshments, an alternative flight/full refund of ticket to the passenger or hotel accommodation, including transfers, depending on the total flight delay. Airlines must provide hotel accommodation only if the delay is more than 24 hours or more than six hours for flights scheduled to depart between 8pm and 3am.Passengers have been pointing these deficiencies out on social media.Sanjay Gupta posted on X that his daughters were booked on a flight from Mopa-Goa to Delhi. "The flight has been delayed many times...daughters are still stuck there. Vistara said, take a refund. What will they do then?".Vamshi Papatla, an X user, posted that he spent Rs 2,400 on cab rides to and from Hyderabad and lost the money paid for a hotel booking in Mumbai after the airline cancelled his Hyderabad-Mumbai flight.Sachin Chhabra, another passenger, posted on X: "Who will bear our hotel and other bookings expenses in case Vistara cancels our flight at the last moment?"|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985380,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1148649,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The court also told them they cannot shield themselves by pinning blame on their officials."It is a violation of undertaking given to the highest court of the land and it cannot be taken lightly. Your apology is not persuading the court. It is a mere lip service. You have to ensure that your undertaking which is solemn should have been adhered to. You violated the solemn undertaking with impunity," the bench said.The court said that their affidavit was not convincing and they could not get away. "Sorry, we are not so magnanimous," the bench said.The Centre and Uttarakhand govt also came under severe criticism for "keeping its eyes shut" on the misdeeds of Patanjali and giving it a long rope despite the company violating the law and claiming to cure incurable diseases including Covid-19 in violation of law.As lawyers of Ramdev and Balkrishna were facing the ire of the court, it was the solicitor general whose intervention came as a relief as he assured the court that as an officer of the court he would sit with them to draft a proper affidavit.

In response to an RTI application, SBI has refused to share the information citing the “exemption” clause of the Right To Information Act. SBI has stated that the SOP was only meant for “internal circulation”.Transparency activist Anjali Bhardwaj in her RTI application dated March 4 sought a copy of the SOPs issued by SBI related to electoral bonds since April 2017.In its response dated March 30 (TOI has a copy), SBI has said, “SOPs of Electoral Bond Scheme-2018 issued to authorised branches from time to time are internal guidelines with regard to sale and redemption of electoral bonds (meant for internal circulation only), which is exempted under Section 8(1)(d) of The Right to Information Act, 2005.”Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act states: “Information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.”Not satisfied with the response Bhardwaj will be filing an appeal. Bhardwaj in a statement on Tuesday said “The SBI has blandly invoked the exemption clause without demonstrating how the disclosure would “harm the competitive position of a third party”. The denial will be challenged in appeal.“Given the lack of clarity over the manner in which SBI recorded data on transactions through Electoral Bonds (EBs), a copy of the SOP was sought under the RTI Act,” Bhardwaj added in the statement.“It is shocking to note that even after the Supreme Court has struck down the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional and has explicitly directed and ensured disclosure of all details of EBs purchased and redeemed, the SBI continues to deny important information about the operation of the electoral bonds scheme,” Bhardwaj asserted.On why the SOP is crucial, Bhardwaj said that it would reveal the official instructions governing the particulars of information that were to be stored, and the form and manner in which information was to be maintained by SBI on the sale and redemption of EBs.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1504345,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-ceding-island-part-of-congresss-historic-failures/articleshow/108984923.cms|PM Modi: Ceding island part of Congress's 'historic failures'|NEW DELHI: PM Modi Tuesday kept up the attack on Congress and DMK as he linked the Indira Gandhi govt's decision to cede Katchatheevu island in Palk Strait to Sri Lanka in 1974 to Congress' "historic failures" in protecting the country's territorial integrity."Can Congress, which was responsible for division of the country, still talks about dividing the country and gave away Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka, protect the country?" Modi asked in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand, at an election rally.He had attacked Congress on Sunday in Meerut for giving away the island to Sri Lanka.Bringing up the issue in the Rudrapur rally, the PM linked it to the valour of jawans from Uttarakhand who sacrificed their lives to protect the country's borders."Uttarakhand is known for brave mothers, whose brave sons stake their lives for every single inch of the motherland but another startling example about Congress's failures has come to the fore. The issue pertains to Tamil Nadu but people of Uttarakhand should also know about Congress's sins," the PM said."Located near Tamil Nadu, Katchatheevu was a part of India but Congress gave it to Sri Lanka. If Indian fishermen go near the island even by mistake, they're arrested and jailed. Tell me, can Congress, which talks about dividing the country, which give away Katchatheevu island, protect the country?" the PM asked.While the PM led from the front, others in the govt and BJP also went on the attack.Union minister Hardeep Puri said the Congress govt in 1974 ought to have taken Parliament's concurrence while ceding the country's territory. He faulted Congress's ally DMK as well and said, "CM M Karunanidhi concurred with the agreement. But DMK opposed it in Parliament."He said territorial issues were negotiated on principle of "give and take" but in case of Katchatheevu, it was only "give" and no "take", with no effort to secure reciprocal concessions from Sri Lanka.The attacks on Congress came amid a sense of satisfaction in party circles that the revelations about India giving up its claim on the island has led the party to defend Indira Gandhi's 1974 deal: a change from the posture where DMK as well as Congress, at least in Tamil Nadu, had washed their hands off it and would demand that Modi govt take steps to retrieve the island.BJP found support from former foreign secretary Harsh Shringla who said it was strange on the part of the then govt to give in to pressure from Sri Lanka when even the British had recognised the island as part of India and not Ceylon as Sri Lanka was then known. "Nehru was indifferent to the issue and Indira Gandhi gave it to Sri Lanka through the delimitation treaty, which was a historical injustice to the country," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1824836,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock's innings provided the much-needed stability to the LSG's batting lineup, allowing them to construct a competitive total of 181 for five.Nicholas Pooran also played a crucial role, remaining unbeaten on 40 from just 21 balls, providing valuable support to De Kock's innings.In response, RCB briefly threatened to chase down the target of 182, primarily through the explosive batting of Mahipal Lomror , who blazed his way to a forceful 33 off just 13 deliveries. However, Lucknow's pace sensation, Mayank Yadav, had other plans.Mayank's scorching three-wicket haul, conceding a mere 14 runs, proved to be the turning point of the match. His fiery spell dismantled the RCB batting order, leaving them struggling at 153 all out.Skipper Faf du Plessis spoke his heart out while talking about young pace sensation Mayank, who single-handedly derailed RCB's run chase."Spot on (dropped catches cost us). Two very good players - QDK was on 25-30 and Pooran was on 2 - 60-65 extra runs, mistakes like that can cost you in the IPL. It is the new action you haven't faced before, and if they have pace then you need time to get used to it (about Mayank). But his ability to control length and have accuracy is impressive," Du Plessis said at the post-match presentation."I didn't think we were very good with our bowling especially in the powerplay, Maxwell brought it back and there were some pleasing signs in the death overs. You need two guys to bat through and get a partnership which we were not able to do. We need the strong characters in the dressing room to put their hands up," Du Plessis added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The seat has been a stronghold of the YSR family since 1989.In this election, Kadapa will witness a triangular contest involving YSRCP, Congress and TDP.Accompanied by her mother and several Congress functionaries, Sharmila visited a memorial to her father before announcing her candidature. She spoke of her dilemma while deciding to contest the Kadapa seat, knowing it could divide her family and confuse YSR's followers."My father dedicated his life to Congress and the people of Andhra Pradesh, earning a special place in their hearts by launching various welfare schemes," Sharmila said.She urged people to support her in upholding her father's ideals and bringing justice to the family of YS Vivekananda Reddy, her paternal uncle. The former minister was found murdered in his bedroom before the 2019 general elections. CBI has been probing the murder for five years."When Viveka was murdered, his death was first rumoured to be due to a heart attack. But when YSRCP came to govt, and it became clearer that Kadapa MP Avinash Reddy was involved in the heinous murder, Jagan not only tried to shield him but has now gone to the extent of fielding him again in Kadapa," Sharmila said.Avinash Reddy said Sharmila's allegations were part of a "larger political conspiracy" against him and his family. "As an elected representative answerable to the public, I will clarify every single allegation levelled against me and remove doubts planted in the minds of the people by TDP and Congress."After snapping ties with Congress and floating YSRCP in 2011, Jagan had been the first to stake claim to YSR's legacy among the two siblings. Sharmila supported him until he became chief minister in 2019. She then surprised everyone by floating her party, YSRTP, in Telangana in 2021.In a dramatic turn of events before the Telangana assembly elections, Sharmila decided not to contest any seat, which apparently helped Congress win the polls and form the govt there. She merged YSRTP with the Grand Old Party soon after and became PCC chief in January.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108982123,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61798,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

On Wednesday, the court will hear Kejriwal's petition challenging his arrest in the money laundering case.The agency opposed any relief and said the CM "is the kingpin and key conspirator of the Delhi excise scam in collusion with ministers of Delhi Govt, AAP leaders and other persons".He was directly involved in the formulation of the Excise Policy 2021-22, it claimed.ED latched on to Kejriwal's submission when he argued in person before the trial court that he didn't oppose ED's plea for custody. "In light of the above submission made by the petitioner that he has no objection to the custody/remand being extended further, the petitioner has waived his right to question his custody as on today and he cannot now be allowed to argue that his custody as on today is illegal," the agency stated.ED said the Delhi CM "intentionally disobeyed" its nine summonses and did not join the investigation based on "one flimsy ground and another." The agency further said that statements of various persons engaged in the election campaign-related activities by AAP in Goa revealed that cash payments were made to them for their work done as survey workers, area managers, assembly managers, etc."These persons and activities related to the election campaign were overall managed by Vijay Nair and Durgesh Pathak, AAP, MLA in Delhi. This shows the dissipation/utilisation of proceeds of crime by the representative of Manish Sisodia in Goa elections," ED claimed in the reply.The agency further stated there was "irrefutable evidence that Rs 45 crore cash was moved through Hawala from various channels (all linked to the South group) to the AAP's Goa campaign."The petition is listed for hearing before Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma on Wednesday.Last month, the high court had refused to grant interim relief to Kejriwal, saying the matter raised important issues that cannot be "summarily" decided without seeking the agency's stand and had asked ED to file its reply to the challenge to his arrest and the subsequent remand to the ED's custody.In the reply, ED further said after filing of the present petition, the petitioner was further remanded to its custody by way of a well-reasoned and detailed remand order till April 1 when he was subsequently sent to judicial custody by the trial court, which was not opposed by his counsel.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984682,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29004,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It shows their desperation.They have ruled the country for 60 years and just because they have been out of office for 10 years, they are so desperate they are speaking of setting the country on fire," the PM said while opening his poll campaign in Uttarakhand. He asked people to ensure a wipeout of Congress "Will you allow the country to be set on fire?" he said.Will you allow the country to be set on fire? Is this language acceptable? Is this the language of democracy? Shouldn't you punish people who say such things? Congress, which has an Emergency-era mentality, has lost faith in democracy and is now trying to incite people against the results, Modi said about Rahul Gandhi's remark.Addressing the 'Loktantra Bachao' rally of INDIA bloc parties in Delhi on Sunday, Rahul had said if BJP secured victory through "match-fixing" in the Lok Sabha polls and altered the Constitution, the country would be on fire and wouldn't survive. The rally also saw Modi strongly pitching for the Citizenship Amendment Act and berating Congress for opposing it . "Our govt introduced CAA to grant citizenship to those loyal to 'Bharat Mata', which is causing the most concern for Congress," Modi said, adding that the majority of refugees who had come from Bangladesh and Pakistan were Dalits, Sikhs and Bengali families. "Congress, which facilitates infiltrators, is now opposing CAA," he said.Stating that people of Uttarakhand could not forget that Congress had insulted a brave son of the nation, the first Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, he said, "Such a party cannot be expected to have patriotism."Referring to Congress MP from Karnataka D K Suresh's comment that people of south India might have to demand a separate country if there was injustice in giving them their rightful share of taxes, Modi said, "Instead of punishing such people, Congress rewards them by giving them tickets to contest polls."The PM said action against the corrupt would go on and he would not be deterred by threats and abuses. "Don't you think the corrupt should go to jail? The corrupt are threatening and abusing me. But they can't deter me. Action against each one of the corrupt persons will continue," he added.He also highlighted the achievements of his party over the last decade, referring to it as a "preview" of what's to come in his third term. "When intentions are right, such work happens naturally. That's why I say, 'neeyat sahi toh nateeje sahi' (if intentions are right, the results are also good)," he said."In the third term, your son will do one more big task. To ensure you get 24-hour electricity, zero electricity bill and earn money from electricity, Modi has started 'Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana'," the PM said, adding that govt was providing assistance to people to set up solar power panels on their rooftops under the scheme. Households consuming 300 units of power on an average would not only get it free but could also earn by selling surplus solar power to govt, he further said.Claiming "unprecedented" development in Uttarakhand over the last decade, Modi said the achievements had surpassed those of the last 65 years. "On the lines of Kedarkhand, we are developing Manaskhand in Uttarakhand. The state's integration into modern connectivity is due to BJP govt's initiatives such as providing 85,000 pucca houses to the poor, water connections to over 12 lakh homes and constructing over 5 lakh toilets," he added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984713,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1149653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

He was remanded in 14 days' judicial remand. Seven others were also arrested in connection with the case.Kanna was booked on March 3 after he and his associates allegedly trespassed into a 10,000sq yard plot, demolished a shed and set it on fire, and assaulted the caretakers.OSR Projects, a private firm, as well as the accused have claimed ownership of the land. A court case is pending in this regard.On March 3, a case was registered against Kanna for attempt to murder, criminal trespass, criminal conspiracy and rioting. Initially, Kanna approached HC seeking anticipatory bail, but his plea was rejected. He again moved HC on Tuesday seeking to quash the FIR against him.

"Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal," she said. "I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment."When asked about the criticism, Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf said the bill was about "protecting people from a rising tide of hatred". "It is not Twitter police. It is not activists, it is not the media. It is not, thank goodness, even politicians who decide ultimately whether or not crime has been committed," Yousaf said. He said it would be up to "the police to investigate, and the threshold for criminality is incredibly high." "Unless your behaviour is threatening and intends to stir up hatred, then you have nothing to worry."Police Scotland said it had received complaints in relation to Rowling's post. "(But) The comments are not assessed to be criminal and no further action will be taken," it said.Earlier, PM Rishi Sunak said Britain had a proud tradition of free speech and that the new law had given the police the wrong priorities. "We should not be criminalising people saying common sense things about biological sex," he told reporters. "Clearly that isn't right."India Willoughby, Britain's first transgender newsreader and one of those who was listed by Rowling, questioned why anyone should "publicly denigrate and mock" trans people. "The best-known author in the world sitting up all night to write a mega-long troll post about me, because she's consumed by a hatred of trans people."Scotland has been at the forefront of extending rights to the transgender community but a previous bid to make it easier to change a legal gender was blocked by London over concerns it would impinge existing equality legislation.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1382013,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Government supporters took to the streets and called for retaliation against Israel.The strike, on part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, killed three generals in Iran's Quds Force and four other officers, making it one of the deadliest attacks of the yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran.Raisi said it was an "inhumane assault in brazen violation of international law," in comments reported by Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency. He added that it will not go unanswered, but gave no details of how Iran might respond.Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said in an earlier post on X that Iran had summoned the Swiss ambassador after midnight local time and asked that an important message be delivered to Washington: That as Israel's ally, the "US must answer" for Israel's actions. Switzerland acts as the US' representative in the absence of diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington. The spokesman for the leadership of Iran's parliament, Seyyed Nezamoldin Mousavi, told Iranian state media that "an appropriate response is a national request by the people of Iran."In Washington, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that "the US had no involvement in the strike" and "did not know about it ahead of time". A US official said a statement had been communicated directly to Iran.In several cities across Iran, including Tehran, large crowds gathered waving Palestinian and Iranian flags and demanding revenge. "Death to Israel" and "Death to America" chanted the crowds, warning that if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared jihad against Israel, then "no army can hold us back."The UNSC will hold an emergency meeting later on Tuesday to discuss Israel's attack. Russia, a close ally of Iran, requested the meeting. Iran's UN ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a letter to the world body that the attack on diplomatic buildings was a violation of international law.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-743426,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The development, which raised concerns about security of the judiciary, comes days after six judges of the Islamabad high court addressed a letter to Supreme Court chief justice Qazi Faes Isa, complaining of meddling in the judicial affairs by the intelligence agencies of the country. Confirming the reception of the letters, Farooq stated during the hearing of a case that the incident contributed to delays in the day's hearings. The Express Tribune newspaper reported judicial sources that when the staff of two judges opened the letters, they found powder inside and subsequently they experienced burning sensations in their eyes. Swift action was taken, with affected individuals using sanitizer and washing their hands as a precautionary measure. A team of experts from the Islamabad police is examining the suspicious powder. It has been revealed that the letters were purportedly written by a woman. The court authorities summoned the police to address the matter urgently. Additionally, the letters have been handed over to the counter-terrorism department for further investigation.

As per projection, this will touch 89,900 km by 2037 and 1.27 lakh km by 2047.The setting up of CMU, which will focus on end-to-end management of NH stretches, is crucial considering that the highway development is likely to reach a saturation level in the next 14-15 years and NHAI staff need to be trained for operation and maintenance of the stretches.The road transport ministry is readying the major organisational reforms and completing processes of consultations for both strengthening of NHAI and restructuring of NHIDCL, an entity responsible for highway development in hilly and north-eastern states. Sources said during the current poll season, infrastructure ministries, including road and housing ministries are making good use of time in completing the preparatory works so that work can start at full speed after the new govt takes charge in June.They added that the housing and urban affairs ministry is completing the process of roll out of different flagship programmes such as PM e-Bus Scheme and finalisation of the Delhi Master Plan. Sources said top PMO officials have also been holding regular review meetings on infrastructure projects and they are also visiting some of the sites.TOI has learnt that in its presentation to the PMO, the road transport ministry has proposed strengthening NHAI considering that it plans to bid out another 60,555 km of NHs for development. “After 14-15 years, our focus will be more on managing the stretches and maintenance and we have to get ready for this,” a source said.The ministry has proposed increasing the sanctioned staff strength, especially in technical posts to meet the work requirement in the next 13-15 years and to increase the NHAI permanent cadre to 90% of the total sanction to “build continuity and deep expertise” in road management. In the current regime, half of the employees are on deputation.The ministry has flagged that staff on deputation typically serve for a fixed term before returning to their parent organisations and this leads to a lack of long-term commitment to NHAI’s projects and goals. It has said that projects requiring long-term oversight suffer from discontinuity. The ministry has also pointed to the problem of limited accountability in case of default or non-compliance as there is limitation on disciplinary action to be taken on staff on deputation.In the case of NHIDCL, the ministry has pointed to how the entity has no regular cadre and the deputation scheme is not attracting enough talent. Moreover, employees on contract are being filled with retired govt personnel only and there is no provision for professionals to be taken on lateral entry basis for fixed tenure contracts.It has proposed having a cadre for the entity with 50% being recruited directly and remaining half on deputation. The ministry has also sought engaging contractual professionals, both retired and from the market, for better functioning of the organisation.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-705834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In a few days, the season will draw to a close after either the 29th or 30th roza. Eid ul' Fitr will be celebrated the following day.Ramzan is the ninth and most important month of the Islamic calendar. It is the promise of All Almighty that fasting is an act performed only for Him and He alone will present the reward of the 'sawm' (Ramzan fast).The month is divided into three 'Ashra's or segments comprising 10 days each, the first promising the Rahmat (mercy) of Allah Almighty, the second Maghfirat (forgiveness) and the third 'Nijaat' (emancipation).The third 'Ashra' brings Ramzan season to full blossom in terms of shopping, feasting and charity. It is then that the most important night of Laylatul' Qadr is believed to fall -- on one of the odd numbered dates, either the 21st, 23rd, 25th or 27th roza.The general belief goes that Shab E' Qadr falls on the night of the 27th roza which is the intervening night of Saturday April 6 and Sunday April 7 this year. Most Muslims, especially those observing the Etikaaf seclusion, intensify prayers this night.As the countdown begins towards Eid ul' Fitr, the imminent separation from the month of blessing is felt keenly. The gentle transition from the pre-dawn Suhoor meal to a regular workday followed by Iftar thanksgiving at sunset, then the special Taraweeh namaz at night will all be missed.Shariq Shaikh, a local businessman from Bandra said, "We settle to a new routine during Ramzan and even tune our shop timings to Iftar and Taraweeh namaz. Many youngsters who fail to pray diligently throughout the year fill the mosques during this holy month."Food is a universal highlight of the season. Residents of the western suburbs have been flocking to savour Ramzan delicacies at an Iftar Bazaar along Jogeshwari SV Road outside the station.A cluster of stalls selling hot kebabs, rolls, fritters, breads, halwa paratha and malpua nestle below the Allah Wali Masjid while others are spread across all the way to Behrambaug Junction.Local vendor Mohammed Sajid said, "In keeping with the spirit of the festival, there is a variety of fare for people of all economic classes and tastes. You will see ten-rupee samosas or kebabs filled with soya or potato -- or spinach and mint with small bits of chicken for Rs 20-25. At the other end of the spectrum there are chicken and mutton kebabs, rolls and rich malpuas costing Rs 100-150 each. A quarter kg of bright orange halwa and hot maida paratha comes for Rs 50. The aim is to ensure that even poor people can fulfil their fast comfortably, and the palate is pleased as well."Meanwhile, needy individuals apart from mosques, madrassas and community NGOs are reinforcing calls for Zakaat donations. Most people opt to offer Zakaat during Ramzan since the reward of each act of piety and prayer is multiplied 70 times.And the mandatory Fitra donation by each fasting individual must be disbursed before men attend the Eid ul' Fitr namaz on the morning of the festival. In olden days its measure was calculated by items like 1.75 kilo of wheat (which was costly since it was scarce), or 3.5 kg of either dates, barley or raisins.

He asserted that India will not create problems for others, however, it will respond appropriately if the country is disturbed."China has given some kind of names to some places in Arunachal Pradesh. But, I don't understand why they are doing that. We are very upset and we totally reject this kind of malicious activities conducted by the Chinese government. Our government from the External Affairs Ministry has responded very appropriately."His remarks come after China recently released a list of 30 places in Arunachal Pradesh in a bid to assert its claim over India's northeastern state. India has been rejecting such renaming of places by China."Now that border areas are seeing the light of modern development. China is reacting to it. China is feeling uncomfortable. They are raising objection why India is building so much infrastructure in the border areas. So, that is why they are resorting to this kind of unethical conduct. But, this India is not the India during Congress time. This is not the 1962 India," he added.According to a March 30 report in its state-run Global Times, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs released a fourth list of standardised geographical names in Zangnan, the name that China uses for Arunachal Pradesh.According to the official website of the ministry, 30 additional publicly used place names in the Zangnan region has been officially revealed, the Global times report said.The Chinese Civil Affairs Ministry released the first list of the so -called standardised names of six places in Zangnan in 2017, while the second list of 15 places was issued in 2021 followed by another list with names for 11 places in 2023.India has repeatedly rebuffed such attempts by China to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh. On Monday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that changing names won't have any effect and the northeastern state was, is and will always be India's part.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108981156,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Mayank Yadav breaks his own record for fastest ball of IPL 2024|NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' pacer Mayank Yadav picked up right where he left off, making an immediate impact in the IPL 2024 match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday.The new pace sensation Mayank bettered his own record of 155.8 KMPH for the fastest ball of this season, unleashing a 156.7 KMPH delivery against RCB.The right-arm pacer, who stole the limelight with his match-winning spell of 3/27 on his IPL debut against Punjab Kings, struck in his first over to dismiss Glenn Maxwell.Mayank then produced an absolute ripper to castle Cameron Green as he got beaten for pace on the outside edge, resulting in the ball crashing into the off stump before racing away to the boundary.There was no stopping Mayank as he went on to pile misery on RCB with his third of the match in the form of Rajat Patidar. He returned astonishing figures of 3/14 in 4 overs.Australia's former fast-bowling star Brett Lee described Mayank as the "talk of the town.""First things first, I don't want to put any extra pressure on him, he is just 21. But he has got great pace and a nice action. I am super impressed with him, and really excited to see how he progresses in the next few months," Lee, a JioCinema IPL expert, said during a roundtable on Tuesday.Mayank had played just two List A games before he was picked by LSG ahead of IPL 2022. He did not play a single match in the first season and was ruled out of the next season with a torn hamstring.After he recovered from the injury, he played for North Zone in the 50-over Deodhar Trophy where he knocked out Rahul Tripathi's middle stump with a ripper.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock departed soon, lofting Reece Topley to Dagar at long-on.The LSG were 143 for four in 16.3 overs at that stage and needed a few more runs to reach safer shores.Pooran, who biffed left-armer seamer Topley for three sixes in a row in the 19th over and two more maximums in the final over off Mohammed Siraj, gave them those during his final assault.Also read: Updated Orange Cap Holder in IPL|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983870,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132002,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/isi-meddling-could-judgess-letter-trigger-a-movement-against-pakistans-military/articleshow/108968739.cms|'ISI meddling': Could judges's letter trigger a movement against Pakistan's military?|Driving the news The backdrop of this controversy is steeped in the long-standing tension between Pakistan’s judiciary and its powerful military establishment. On March 26, six judges from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) took the extraordinary step of penning a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), voicing concerns over what they described as "brazen meddling" by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Pakistani military’s premier intelligence agency, in judicial matters. This unprecedented move laid bare the undercurrents of unease within the judiciary regarding the military’s influence over legal proceedings. The six judges who signed the March 25 dated letter include Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz. In their letter, the judges detailed several instances of alleged interference, including pressure on judges through abduction and torture of relatives and the installation of surveillance equipment in their homes. The revelations contained within the letter were nothing short of explosive, suggesting not just isolated incidents but a systemic attempt to sway judicial outcomes. The response to the judges’ letter has been a litany of actions and reactions. The government’s decision to appoint a one-member commission headed by former Chief Supreme Court Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who later declined the role, was met with skepticism from various quarters, including the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and the legal community. They argued for the Supreme Court to employ its suo motu powers to address the allegations directly, leading to the establishment of a seven-member bench to hear the case. Why it matters The judges' letter has thrown a spotlight on deep-seated issues within Pakistan's judiciary, alleging interference that ranges from surveillance within judges' homes to the abduction and torture of their relatives. Such serious accusations against the intelligence services, particularly the ISI, underscore a potential crisis of judicial independence and public trust in the legal system. The core question arising from this saga is whether the judges' bold step will lead to a significant shift in the civil-military relationship or if it will merely be another chapter in the ongoing saga of power struggles, with no real change in the status quo. Zoom in The historical context is illuminating. Previous instances of tension between the judiciary and the military, such as the removal of former IHC Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, underscore the challenges faced by judges in maintaining judicial independence amid external pressures. Siddiqui's case, cited by the IHC judges in their letter, is a stark reminder of the consequences of confronting the military’s influence head-on. Public reactions and political maneuverings in the wake of the letter's publication have followed a familiar pattern, with divisions along party lines and a mix of condemnation and support for the judges. The PTI’s call for an increase in the number of judges hearing the case reflects the political undercurrents that permeate this issue. What they are saying Gohar Khan, PTI chief: "We support the decision by the court but the number of judges should be increased." Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Qazi Faez Isa: "Meddling by the executive in the affairs and 'judicial workings of judges will not be tolerated' come what may." IHC Judges in the letter: The judges detail “brazen meddling” and instances of intimidation, including efforts to influence the outcome of cases and the abduction and torture of relatives. What's next The question is, will this naturally lead to a lawyers’ movement, like the one in 2007-08 that contributed to the ouster of military dictator Pervez Musharraf ? ? According to Arifa Noor, a columnist in Dawn, this isn't a scenario where civilian groups unite against a tyrannical ruler, leading us to believe we're on the brink of significant transformation. Instead, we're engaged in a prolonged struggle, driven by the efforts of small factions and solitary endeavors, without an imminent conclusion. "More than a decade after Musharraf’s departure, we have understood that it is not easy to bring down the edifice of a structure put into place over decades, through a year or two of agitation and street protests. Such victories, in hindsight, appear to be a mirage.," Noor said in her column in the Dawn. (With inputs from agencies) NEW DELHI: In a significant turn of events, Pakistan’s Supreme Court announced on Monday its decision to address allegations of interference by the country's intelligence agencies in judicial affairs, as outlined in a remarkable letter by six high court judges.

He also claimed that great injustice has been done to Hemant.“BJP-led forces may have succeeded in putting him behind bars but the tribals of Jharkhand will show the Bharatiya Janata Party the exit door in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. We are more than confident of winning all 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state," Champai Soren said.Meanwhile, Sita Soren, who joined the BJP earlier this month, has launched an all-out attack against her family members. Sita has alleged "continued neglect and isolation" by the JMM and has also claimed that Hemant Soren's wife Kalpana had "insulted" her.Sita is the wife of Shibu Soren's elder son Durga Soren who died in 2009. She has now demanded high-level probe into the "mysterious death" of her husband."The change that came in our lives after my husband's death was no less than a nightmare. We were neglected and isolated socially and politically," Sita has claimed.Launching a scathing attack on JMM, Sita accused the party of "deviating from its principle and indulging in corruption".For the JMM, selecting a candidate for Dumka could be a tough call. The party would be wary of the political consequences in case a family member loses to BJP's Sita Soren in Shibu Soren's stronghold.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108982805,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-82230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The call, lasting for one hour and 45 minutes, also saw both leaders agreeing to reopen military communications and collaborate in combating fentanyl production, following their November consensus.The discussion touched upon various contentious issues, including China's support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict, economic trade practices, human rights violations in Xinjiang, and denuclearization efforts in the Korean peninsula. Biden also raised concerns about escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where China's actions have been deemed destabilizing, especially against Philippine maritime operations.Both leaders sought to build on recent improvements in relations, which had deteriorated after a U.S. fighter jet downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. Efforts to re-establish communication channels have been underway, with Biden and Xi emphasizing the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and managing their relationship through diplomacy and consultations.The White House noted ongoing efforts to ensure responsible handling of the relationship, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meeting U.S. officials in January and February, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen scheduled to visit China in April. Discussions between Biden and Xi also explored areas of mutual interest, such as counternarcotics efforts, AI safety concerns, military communication resumption, and climate change initiatives.As both nations navigate complex issues, the importance of dialogue and cooperation remains paramount in addressing shared challenges and preventing further escalations in tensions. The leaders' commitment to managing competition, avoiding conflicts, and finding common ground highlights the ongoing efforts to foster stability and cooperation in the U.S.-China relationship.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108982521,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-669524,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The incident occurred near Salarpur in the Dewa police station area.The ill-fated bus was carrying students from Suratganj Composite School, who had traveled to Lucknow for an educational excursion to visit the Lucknow zoo and regional science center, the police said.In total, 42 children, four teachers, a bus driver, and a conductor were on the bus at the start of the journey.

All three were students of class 8, while the fourth victim was identified as Sufiyan Ansari (28), the bus conductor.Additional Superintendent of Police, Barabanki, Chiranjeev Nath Sinha, said that preliminary investigations suggest that around 6.10 pm, the bus encountered a high-speed motorcycle during its return near Salarpur, prompting the driver to swerve to avoid a collision. Regrettably, this manoeuvre led to the bus veering off the road and overturning into a nearby ditch, resulting in the loss of precious young lives."Upon hearing the commotion and cries of the children, scores of villagers rushed to the scene to offer assistance.

I hope I am saying it so clearly that not only in the country but beyond the country also people get that message very very clearly," he said.Meanwhile, Jaishankar also came down heavily on Congress leader P Chidambram over the Katchatheevu island row. the EAM said that the fishermen of Tamil Nadu should know who put them in this situation.In his tweets on X earlier, Chidambaram said any "untruthful and belligerent" statement about the island will bring the Sri Lankan government and 35 lakh Tamils into confrontation. Jaishankar did a "somersault" on the issue, and once a liberal foreign service officer, he became a mouthpiece of the RSS-BJP, the former Union minister said.Jaishankar said he did not mind people disputing his statements that then prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi gave no importance to the island and the legal opinion regarding negotiating fishing rights with Sri Lanka was disregarded."But these are public documents. By saying that today Jaishankar is in BJP or not -- Jaishankar is in BJP and is proud to be in BJP -- does not change anything. Facts are facts, truth is truth. Fishermen of Tamil Nadu should know who has put them in that situation," he said.The issue is not what was the (then) government's position... the issue is the public should know that the DMK was complicit in it," he added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108982110,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-657924,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This temperature , seven times hotter than the core of the sun, was maintained during a nuclear fusion experiment, marking a significant advancement in the development of this futuristic energy source .Nuclear fusion, which mimics the processes powering the sun and other stars, involves fusing two atoms together to release vast amounts of energy. This clean energy source promises to provide unlimited energy without contributing to carbon pollution, positioning it as a pivotal solution in combating climate change. However, the technical challenges of replicating this process on Earth have been immense, a CNN report said.The key to achieving fusion energy lies in the tokamak, a donut-shaped reactor that heats hydrogen variants to create a plasma—a state of matter where atomic nuclei and electrons are separated. According to Si-Woo Yoon, director of the KSTAR Research Center at the Korean Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE), maintaining high temperature and high density plasmas where fusion reactions can occur over long durations is crucial for the success of future nuclear fusion reactors.The KSTAR device, dubbed an "artificial sun" by the KFE, achieved this latest record by sustaining plasma temperatures of 100 million degrees for 48 seconds during tests conducted between December 2023 and February 2024. This achievement surpasses the previous record of 30 seconds set in 2021.Modifications to the process, including the substitution of tungsten for carbon in components known as diverters—which remove heat and impurities from the fusion reaction—were instrumental in extending the duration of the plasma state.The ultimate goal for KSTAR is to maintain these plasma temperatures for 300 seconds by 2026, a milestone that Si-Woo Yoon considers a "critical point" for scaling up fusion operations. The advancements made in South Korea are expected to contribute significantly to the development of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in southern France, the world's largest tokamak, which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy.This announcement follows a series of breakthroughs in nuclear fusion research, including a successful reaction at the National Ignition Facility in the United States that produced more energy than was used to power it, and a record-setting fusion energy output near Oxford, England.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108970110,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1473531,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It is reasonable to infer that it is these police officials who have released the accused mother’s name to the media,” the court said.It added that the cops’ action violates the court’s Nov 2019 directions, and the police department’s own circulars, office memorandums, and guidelines.Police parading and posing with accused persons shows disregard for human rights, the right to privacy, and the right to live with dignity, the HC had observed.The 2019 case was initiated by the HC after two police personnel had similarly paraded a woman before the media for having allegedly abandoned her child.The division bench at the time had observed that photographs of police personnel posing with the woman conjured images of some “Maharajas/hunters posing with their trophies after a hunt” and directed police to pay compensation to the woman.The court had held that such parading of accused persons and the police personnel posing for photographs with the accused mother amounts to the violation of the mother’s right to privacy and the right to live with dignity as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.In its latest order, the court said that at least prima facie, this appears to be a repeat, even though disciplinary proceedings were initiated against two police personnel in the earlier case, and they were punished.The court further observed that Silva, who is seen posing in one of the photographs, had himself filed a compliance report in the HC along with guidelines on interactions of police with the media in 2019.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The affidavits are meant to explain the circumstances surrounding the application for felling the trees and how permission was granted.The HC was told that the owners of the private properties neither applied for permission for cutting the trees nor gave govt NOCs to go ahead with the felling.While hearing the matter on Tuesday, the HC said it was most unusual for govt or engineers of the PWD to apply for felling of trees which do not belong to govt.With no answers coming forth, the court observed that “fear” was operating.The permission granted by the forest department for felling the trees had lapsed and was not in force when the trees were cut last month, advocate general Devidas Pangam said. He added that the road-widening project at Siolim had not taken off yet.He agreed that the procedure followed was flawed and said a chargesheet must be filed against those responsible.What is the security of our trees if govt grants permission for felling 205 trees when the private parties themselves have not applied for permission, the division bench of the HC asked.The private contractor declined to tell the court who engaged him to cut 30-odd trees.The HC said it was difficult to accept that Rafik Munna Sabji, the contractor, could cut the trees in private properties without some go-ahead.Govt was then asked by the HC why the investigating agencies could not find out at whose behest the trees were cut.A file about the investigations carried out by the range forest officer was shown to the HC during the hearing. The court returned the file but directed that a copy be placed before it in a sealed cover.MLA Michael Lobo has been impleaded as a respondent in the case. At the last hearing, the petitioners submitted videos of Lobo talking about the road-widening work.“I admit that I have cut many trees but we have also planted many,” Lobo has purportedly said in a video. “Now many people will abuse me and say many bad things about me, about how I am destroying nature, but this work is required.”The issue has been a source of controversy after citizen groups protested about heritage trees being felled too, all without permission.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Otherwise, it was a quiet first night in prison for Kejriwal.Though prison officials described the incarcerated CM as "slightly uncomfortable" in the barracks at night, Kejriwal stuck to his usual routine even in jail.He didn't have the regular jail food but was given home-cooked food on the court orders plus his medicines. He woke up early to do some yoga and had the jail breakfast comprising bread and tea. He was then mostly seen walking around in the cell or reading a book. Guards are on alert after inputs suggested that some inmates could try to harm Kejriwal for "fame".Sources said that on Monday night, Kejriwal used only one shawl that he had brought from home, using the rest of the jail issued material for his bedding. From time to time, he paced around in his cell. A jail source said that prison doctors checked the AAP national convener's blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar level, which were normal. "He was given homemade lunch and then between 3.30pm and 6pm, he came out of his cell and walked, sat and did some reading," the source added.According to sources, Kejriwal also talked to his wife and one more family member through a video conference. He also met a lawyer in prison and signed some papers.Tihar's Jail No. 2 has a chequered past. In 2021, an inmate named Srikan Ramaswami was murdered there during a gang war that erupted in the complex. Ramaswami, a resident of Delhi's Ashok Vihar, had been arrested in a murder case in 2015. The prison authorities told the court that four undertrials beat the criminal with cricket bats around 7am on May 14. Police arrested the four suspects but the Court transferred the investigation of the murder to CBI. The Tihar administration had also recently recovered 33 mobile phones during surprise checks in jail.Another source added that the CM is lodged in the general ward, where petty criminals are also held, including those accused of thefts, domestic violence, pick pocketing and such crimes. There are also high-security wards in Jail No. 2 where gangsters from the Gogi and Tillu gangs and some militants are lodged. These wards are under heightened security and have heavy barricading.Terrorist Zia Ur Rehman is among the known notorious characters lodged in the jail, which has a population of around 600. The adjacent jail, No. 3, is known to hold dreaded criminals and several murders have been reported from there in the last few years. Last April, gangster Prince Tewatia was killed in an early-morning attack in that jail by rival gang members following an altercation with an inmate.The CM will be in jail for two weeks after being sent into judicial custody by a court on Monday in connection with a case related to the Delhi excise policy of 2021-22.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108986068,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1619512,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Additionally, two Maoists , carrying a combined reward of Rs 43 lakh, were killed in a night shootout in MP's Balaghat district, police confirmed Tuesday.The seizure of a light machine-gun, AK-47 rifles and several under-barrel grenade launchers in Bijapur suggests the presence of a high-ranking Maoist leader among those killed.According to police, the toll may rise as several other insurgents were wounded.Since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took office last Dec, a total of 47 Maoists have been killed in the state.Police sources attributed the success of the operation to accurate and timely technical intelligence. Authorities were alerted Monday evening about the movement of around 100 heavily armed Maoists in the Gangaloor region, a known insurgency hotspot near the Telangana border. Responding to the intelligence, a joint force comprising CoBRA commandos, CRPF, District Reserve Guards, and Special Task Force mobilised to intercept them.The shootout ensued around 6am Tuesday when security forces engaged the Maoists in the forests between Lendra and Korcholi villages in Gangaloor. The gunfight resulted in the recovery of the bodies of four Maoists initially, followed by six more and additional weaponry and Maoist material.The operation is ongoing, with further details expected as it progresses, Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI. "The slain Maoists will be identified after the bodies are brought to base," he said. They are believed to be from PLGA Company No 2. With heightened security operations ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, 22 Maoists have been eliminated in the fortnight since the announcement of election dates. Deputy CM Vijay Sharma expressed concern over the recovery of automatic weapons, highlighting the need for further investigation into their source.In MP, a gunfight broke out around 9pm Monday in Kerajhari forest of Balaghat district, situated near the border with Chhattisgarh, and continued for over two hours. Upon conducting a search of the area early Tuesday, police discovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist divisional committee member Sajanti, also known as Kranti, and area committee member Raghu, alias Sher Singh, aged 54. Both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounties announced by police in three states - MP, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

However, passengers whose flights have been cancelled or delayed have learnt that these norms do not address some of their core concerns.For instance: For a flight cancellation done within 24 hours of departure, the norms state that the airline should either provide an alternative flight or refund the ticket and pay compensation ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, depending on the length of the journey.For passengers who are not accommodated on an alternative flight, this compensation amount hardly covers the costs they would have to incur in buying a last-minute ticket to their destination.On Tuesday, Sushil Patni and his wife, both senior citizens, ended up spending Rs 21,000 to book tickets on IndiGo to fly to Delhi from Indore after Vistara cancelled their flight. They were booked on an evening departure to Baku and so could not wait for a day for alternative arrangements. Under the said norms, together they would get a compensation of Rs 15,000.Then again, the provisions mention free hotel accommodation only in case of flight delay, and not for cancellations. It states that the airline is required to provide meals and refreshments, an alternative flight/full refund of ticket to the passenger or hotel accommodation, including transfers, depending on the total flight delay. Airlines must provide hotel accommodation only if the delay is more than 24 hours or more than six hours for flights scheduled to depart between 8pm and 3am.Passengers have been pointing these deficiencies out on social media.Sanjay Gupta posted on X that his daughters were booked on a flight from Mopa-Goa to Delhi. "The flight has been delayed many times...daughters are still stuck there. Vistara said, take a refund. What will they do then?".Vamshi Papatla, an X user, posted that he spent Rs 2,400 on cab rides to and from Hyderabad and lost the money paid for a hotel booking in Mumbai after the airline cancelled his Hyderabad-Mumbai flight.Sachin Chhabra, another passenger, posted on X: "Who will bear our hotel and other bookings expenses in case Vistara cancels our flight at the last moment?"|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985380,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1148649,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/60-vistara-flights-cancelled-regulator-seeks-daily-updates/articleshow/108985227.cms|60+ Vistara flights cancelled, regulator seeks daily updates|DGCA: Vistara flight disruptions due to crew unavailability NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) on Tuesday asked crisis-hit Vistara to provide it with daily information on flight cancellations and delays and to extend flyers all facilities due to them, along with refunds and compensation. The development came on a day that saw the airline cancelling more than 60 flights, after almost 50 on Monday, as reported by TOI.Vistara has a daily schedule of over 350 domestic and international flights.On Tuesday, from Mumbai alone, the airline cancelled 14 departures and 17 arrivals. On international routes, flights from Mumbai to Paris and Male were cancelled. Passengers booked on connecting international flights out of Delhi and Mumbai were worst hit. Kolkata had one cancellation and several delays. The airline has yet to issue a statement.On-time performance (OTP) of Vistara's currently operating flights has nosedived because of an ongoing pilot shortage . On Monday, just 51% of the airline's domestic flights had been on time, according to data on the aviation ministry website."We are monitoring the situation to ensure compliance and minimise passenger inconvenience," said a senior DGCA official.DGCA says Vistara has been seeing flight disruptions "due to various reasons, including crew unavailability". While pilots remain dissatisfied over "pay cuts" they will have to endure when the airline merges with Air India, and for other reasons, sources in Vistara say they hope the issue will be resolved by this week. "Our Tuesday OTP was much better than Monday's, though there still are some delays. As far as pilots being unhappy over being shifted from a minimum payment of 70 hours to 40 hours per month (under the new agreement they had to sign as Vistara prepares for the merger) is concerned, they will actually make more than before as utilisation is more than 70 hours for active pilots," said a source.Vistara operations returning to normal is crucial for this capacity-constrained peak summer travel season. Already, passengers now looking to either rebook on other airlines or making fresh bookings while avoiding Vistara are complaining of fares spiking. For instance, the cheapest economy ticket on budget carriers flying from Bengaluru to Delhi on April 6 and flying back on April 14 starts from upwards of Rs 25,000 and goes up to Rs 46,000, searches on online travel agencies show."I was asleep when the airline messaged late at night that our 8.20am flight from Indore to Delhi had been cancelled," said Sushil Patni, a senior citizen travelling with his wife to Azerbaijan. "We then booked the 10am IndiGo flight to Chandigarh, from where we flew to Delhi, as were booked on the 9pm flight to Baku. We ended up spending over Rs 21,000 for the last-minute IndiGo flight to Delhi via Chandigarh."With almost 75 IndiGo planes grounded because of snag-ridden Pratt & Whitney engines, GoAir not flying since last May, SpiceJet operating few flights, and supply of new planes being slower than promised from both Boeing and Airbus, the Vistara crisis could not have at a worse time, just ahead of the peak summer travel season.Vistara has a schedule to operate 2,324 weekly domestic flights this summer, 25% more than last summer's 1,856. A dip in this will add to the ongoing shortage amid runaway demand and could lead to skyrocketing airfares.Aware of the heartburn this could cause in the busy poll season, the aviation ministry on Tuesday said it was monitoring the situation of Vistara flight cancellations.Analysing what's going wrong, senior pilots in AI and Vistara said introduction of the new wage agreement for Vistara pilots was not done properly. "There was no consideration of seniority and experience for staff in the merged entity. The pilots were not consulted. Some in the senior management don't have adequate experience and maturity to handle the complicated process of merger Crew scheduling has not considered adequate fatigue and lifestyle management," said a senior pilot.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1487272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The court also told them they cannot shield themselves by pinning blame on their officials."It is a violation of undertaking given to the highest court of the land and it cannot be taken lightly. Your apology is not persuading the court. It is a mere lip service. You have to ensure that your undertaking which is solemn should have been adhered to. You violated the solemn undertaking with impunity," the bench said.The court said that their affidavit was not convincing and they could not get away. "Sorry, we are not so magnanimous," the bench said.The Centre and Uttarakhand govt also came under severe criticism for "keeping its eyes shut" on the misdeeds of Patanjali and giving it a long rope despite the company violating the law and claiming to cure incurable diseases including Covid-19 in violation of law.As lawyers of Ramdev and Balkrishna were facing the ire of the court, it was the solicitor general whose intervention came as a relief as he assured the court that as an officer of the court he would sit with them to draft a proper affidavit. He agreed that their conduct was not acceptable.The court was hearing a petition filed by Indian Medical Association.The apex court had in its earlier hearing in Nov recorded Patanjali's lawyer Sajan Poovayya assurance that the company won't publish such misleading advertisements.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1924789,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-ceding-island-part-of-congresss-historic-failures/articleshow/108984923.cms|PM Modi: Ceding island part of Congress's 'historic failures'|NEW DELHI: PM Modi Tuesday kept up the attack on Congress and DMK as he linked the Indira Gandhi govt's decision to cede Katchatheevu island in Palk Strait to Sri Lanka in 1974 to Congress' "historic failures" in protecting the country's territorial integrity."Can Congress, which was responsible for division of the country, still talks about dividing the country and gave away Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka, protect the country?" Modi asked in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand, at an election rally.He had attacked Congress on Sunday in Meerut for giving away the island to Sri Lanka.Bringing up the issue in the Rudrapur rally, the PM linked it to the valour of jawans from Uttarakhand who sacrificed their lives to protect the country's borders."Uttarakhand is known for brave mothers, whose brave sons stake their lives for every single inch of the motherland but another startling example about Congress's failures has come to the fore. The issue pertains to Tamil Nadu but people of Uttarakhand should also know about Congress's sins," the PM said."Located near Tamil Nadu, Katchatheevu was a part of India but Congress gave it to Sri Lanka. If Indian fishermen go near the island even by mistake, they're arrested and jailed. Tell me, can Congress, which talks about dividing the country, which give away Katchatheevu island, protect the country?" the PM asked.While the PM led from the front, others in the govt and BJP also went on the attack.Union minister Hardeep Puri said the Congress govt in 1974 ought to have taken Parliament's concurrence while ceding the country's territory. He faulted Congress's ally DMK as well and said, "CM M Karunanidhi concurred with the agreement. But DMK opposed it in Parliament."He said territorial issues were negotiated on principle of "give and take" but in case of Katchatheevu, it was only "give" and no "take", with no effort to secure reciprocal concessions from Sri Lanka.The attacks on Congress came amid a sense of satisfaction in party circles that the revelations about India giving up its claim on the island has led the party to defend Indira Gandhi's 1974 deal: a change from the posture where DMK as well as Congress, at least in Tamil Nadu, had washed their hands off it and would demand that Modi govt take steps to retrieve the island.BJP found support from former foreign secretary Harsh Shringla who said it was strange on the part of the then govt to give in to pressure from Sri Lanka when even the British had recognised the island as part of India and not Ceylon as Sri Lanka was then known. "Nehru was indifferent to the issue and Indira Gandhi gave it to Sri Lanka through the delimitation treaty, which was a historical injustice to the country," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1824836,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It shows their desperation.They have ruled the country for 60 years and just because they have been out of office for 10 years, they are so desperate they are speaking of setting the country on fire," the PM said while opening his poll campaign in Uttarakhand. He asked people to ensure a wipeout of Congress "Will you allow the country to be set on fire?" he said.Will you allow the country to be set on fire? Is this language acceptable? Is this the language of democracy? Shouldn't you punish people who say such things? Congress, which has an Emergency-era mentality, has lost faith in democracy and is now trying to incite people against the results, Modi said about Rahul Gandhi's remark.Addressing the 'Loktantra Bachao' rally of INDIA bloc parties in Delhi on Sunday, Rahul had said if BJP secured victory through "match-fixing" in the Lok Sabha polls and altered the Constitution, the country would be on fire and wouldn't survive. The rally also saw Modi strongly pitching for the Citizenship Amendment Act and berating Congress for opposing it . "Our govt introduced CAA to grant citizenship to those loyal to 'Bharat Mata', which is causing the most concern for Congress," Modi said, adding that the majority of refugees who had come from Bangladesh and Pakistan were Dalits, Sikhs and Bengali families. "Congress, which facilitates infiltrators, is now opposing CAA," he said.Stating that people of Uttarakhand could not forget that Congress had insulted a brave son of the nation, the first Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, he said, "Such a party cannot be expected to have patriotism."Referring to Congress MP from Karnataka D K Suresh's comment that people of south India might have to demand a separate country if there was injustice in giving them their rightful share of taxes, Modi said, "Instead of punishing such people, Congress rewards them by giving them tickets to contest polls."The PM said action against the corrupt would go on and he would not be deterred by threats and abuses. "Don't you think the corrupt should go to jail? The corrupt are threatening and abusing me. But they can't deter me. Action against each one of the corrupt persons will continue," he added.He also highlighted the achievements of his party over the last decade, referring to it as a "preview" of what's to come in his third term. "When intentions are right, such work happens naturally. That's why I say, 'neeyat sahi toh nateeje sahi' (if intentions are right, the results are also good)," he said."In the third term, your son will do one more big task. To ensure you get 24-hour electricity, zero electricity bill and earn money from electricity, Modi has started 'Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana'," the PM said, adding that govt was providing assistance to people to set up solar power panels on their rooftops under the scheme. Households consuming 300 units of power on an average would not only get it free but could also earn by selling surplus solar power to govt, he further said.Claiming "unprecedented" development in Uttarakhand over the last decade, Modi said the achievements had surpassed those of the last 65 years. "On the lines of Kedarkhand, we are developing Manaskhand in Uttarakhand. The state's integration into modern connectivity is due to BJP govt's initiatives such as providing 85,000 pucca houses to the poor, water connections to over 12 lakh homes and constructing over 5 lakh toilets," he added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984713,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1149653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal," she said. "I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment."When asked about the criticism, Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf said the bill was about "protecting people from a rising tide of hatred". "It is not Twitter police. It is not activists, it is not the media. It is not, thank goodness, even politicians who decide ultimately whether or not crime has been committed," Yousaf said. He said it would be up to "the police to investigate, and the threshold for criminality is incredibly high." "Unless your behaviour is threatening and intends to stir up hatred, then you have nothing to worry."Police Scotland said it had received complaints in relation to Rowling's post. "(But) The comments are not assessed to be criminal and no further action will be taken," it said.Earlier, PM Rishi Sunak said Britain had a proud tradition of free speech and that the new law had given the police the wrong priorities. "We should not be criminalising people saying common sense things about biological sex," he told reporters. "Clearly that isn't right."India Willoughby, Britain's first transgender newsreader and one of those who was listed by Rowling, questioned why anyone should "publicly denigrate and mock" trans people. "The best-known author in the world sitting up all night to write a mega-long troll post about me, because she's consumed by a hatred of trans people."Scotland has been at the forefront of extending rights to the transgender community but a previous bid to make it easier to change a legal gender was blocked by London over concerns it would impinge existing equality legislation.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1382013,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In a few days, the season will draw to a close after either the 29th or 30th roza. Eid ul' Fitr will be celebrated the following day.Ramzan is the ninth and most important month of the Islamic calendar. It is the promise of All Almighty that fasting is an act performed only for Him and He alone will present the reward of the 'sawm' (Ramzan fast).The month is divided into three 'Ashra's or segments comprising 10 days each, the first promising the Rahmat (mercy) of Allah Almighty, the second Maghfirat (forgiveness) and the third 'Nijaat' (emancipation).The third 'Ashra' brings Ramzan season to full blossom in terms of shopping, feasting and charity. It is then that the most important night of Laylatul' Qadr is believed to fall -- on one of the odd numbered dates, either the 21st, 23rd, 25th or 27th roza.The general belief goes that Shab E' Qadr falls on the night of the 27th roza which is the intervening night of Saturday April 6 and Sunday April 7 this year. Most Muslims, especially those observing the Etikaaf seclusion, intensify prayers this night.As the countdown begins towards Eid ul' Fitr, the imminent separation from the month of blessing is felt keenly. The gentle transition from the pre-dawn Suhoor meal to a regular workday followed by Iftar thanksgiving at sunset, then the special Taraweeh namaz at night will all be missed.Shariq Shaikh, a local businessman from Bandra said, "We settle to a new routine during Ramzan and even tune our shop timings to Iftar and Taraweeh namaz. Many youngsters who fail to pray diligently throughout the year fill the mosques during this holy month."Food is a universal highlight of the season. Residents of the western suburbs have been flocking to savour Ramzan delicacies at an Iftar Bazaar along Jogeshwari SV Road outside the station.A cluster of stalls selling hot kebabs, rolls, fritters, breads, halwa paratha and malpua nestle below the Allah Wali Masjid while others are spread across all the way to Behrambaug Junction.Local vendor Mohammed Sajid said, "In keeping with the spirit of the festival, there is a variety of fare for people of all economic classes and tastes. You will see ten-rupee samosas or kebabs filled with soya or potato -- or spinach and mint with small bits of chicken for Rs 20-25. At the other end of the spectrum there are chicken and mutton kebabs, rolls and rich malpuas costing Rs 100-150 each. A quarter kg of bright orange halwa and hot maida paratha comes for Rs 50. The aim is to ensure that even poor people can fulfil their fast comfortably, and the palate is pleased as well."Meanwhile, needy individuals apart from mosques, madrassas and community NGOs are reinforcing calls for Zakaat donations. Most people opt to offer Zakaat during Ramzan since the reward of each act of piety and prayer is multiplied 70 times.And the mandatory Fitra donation by each fasting individual must be disbursed before men attend the Eid ul' Fitr namaz on the morning of the festival. In olden days its measure was calculated by items like 1.75 kilo of wheat (which was costly since it was scarce), or 3.5 kg of either dates, barley or raisins. Today it is distributed in the cash equivalent.Mosques have released the annual amount of Fitra to be given this year. The Sadaqatul Fitr amount for Ramzan 2024 calculated by Markazul Ma'arif in Jogeshwari is Rs 70 (1.5 kg of wheat) or Rs 140 (3.5 kg barley) or Rs 900 (3.5 kg of dates) or Rs 1,050 (3.5 kg raisins). A fasting Muslim man or woman may choose to donate any of these amounts as per their wish or capacity, but most people choose to pay the best they can.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80730,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Otherwise, it was a quiet first night in prison for Kejriwal.Though prison officials described the incarcerated CM as "slightly uncomfortable" in the barracks at night, Kejriwal stuck to his usual routine even in jail.He didn't have the regular jail food but was given home-cooked food on the court orders plus his medicines. He woke up early to do some yoga and had the jail breakfast comprising bread and tea. He was then mostly seen walking around in the cell or reading a book. Guards are on alert after inputs suggested that some inmates could try to harm Kejriwal for "fame".Sources said that on Monday night, Kejriwal used only one shawl that he had brought from home, using the rest of the jail issued material for his bedding. From time to time, he paced around in his cell. A jail source said that prison doctors checked the AAP national convener's blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar level, which were normal. "He was given homemade lunch and then between 3.30pm and 6pm, he came out of his cell and walked, sat and did some reading," the source added.According to sources, Kejriwal also talked to his wife and one more family member through a video conference. He also met a lawyer in prison and signed some papers.Tihar's Jail No. 2 has a chequered past. In 2021, an inmate named Srikan Ramaswami was murdered there during a gang war that erupted in the complex. Ramaswami, a resident of Delhi's Ashok Vihar, had been arrested in a murder case in 2015. The prison authorities told the court that four undertrials beat the criminal with cricket bats around 7am on May 14. Police arrested the four suspects but the Court transferred the investigation of the murder to CBI. The Tihar administration had also recently recovered 33 mobile phones during surprise checks in jail.Another source added that the CM is lodged in the general ward, where petty criminals are also held, including those accused of thefts, domestic violence, pick pocketing and such crimes. There are also high-security wards in Jail No. 2 where gangsters from the Gogi and Tillu gangs and some militants are lodged. These wards are under heightened security and have heavy barricading.Terrorist Zia Ur Rehman is among the known notorious characters lodged in the jail, which has a population of around 600. The adjacent jail, No. 3, is known to hold dreaded criminals and several murders have been reported from there in the last few years. Last April, gangster Prince Tewatia was killed in an early-morning attack in that jail by rival gang members following an altercation with an inmate.The CM will be in jail for two weeks after being sent into judicial custody by a court on Monday in connection with a case related to the Delhi excise policy of 2021-22.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108986068,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1619512,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Additionally, two Maoists , carrying a combined reward of Rs 43 lakh, were killed in a night shootout in MP's Balaghat district, police confirmed Tuesday.The seizure of a light machine-gun, AK-47 rifles and several under-barrel grenade launchers in Bijapur suggests the presence of a high-ranking Maoist leader among those killed.According to police, the toll may rise as several other insurgents were wounded.Since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took office last Dec, a total of 47 Maoists have been killed in the state.Police sources attributed the success of the operation to accurate and timely technical intelligence. Authorities were alerted Monday evening about the movement of around 100 heavily armed Maoists in the Gangaloor region, a known insurgency hotspot near the Telangana border. Responding to the intelligence, a joint force comprising CoBRA commandos, CRPF, District Reserve Guards, and Special Task Force mobilised to intercept them.The shootout ensued around 6am Tuesday when security forces engaged the Maoists in the forests between Lendra and Korcholi villages in Gangaloor. The gunfight resulted in the recovery of the bodies of four Maoists initially, followed by six more and additional weaponry and Maoist material.The operation is ongoing, with further details expected as it progresses, Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI. "The slain Maoists will be identified after the bodies are brought to base," he said. They are believed to be from PLGA Company No 2. With heightened security operations ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, 22 Maoists have been eliminated in the fortnight since the announcement of election dates. Deputy CM Vijay Sharma expressed concern over the recovery of automatic weapons, highlighting the need for further investigation into their source.In MP, a gunfight broke out around 9pm Monday in Kerajhari forest of Balaghat district, situated near the border with Chhattisgarh, and continued for over two hours. Upon conducting a search of the area early Tuesday, police discovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist divisional committee member Sajanti, also known as Kranti, and area committee member Raghu, alias Sher Singh, aged 54. Both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounties announced by police in three states - MP, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The court also told them they cannot shield themselves by pinning blame on their officials."It is a violation of undertaking given to the highest court of the land and it cannot be taken lightly. Your apology is not persuading the court. It is a mere lip service. You have to ensure that your undertaking which is solemn should have been adhered to. You violated the solemn undertaking with impunity," the bench said.The court said that their affidavit was not convincing and they could not get away. "Sorry, we are not so magnanimous," the bench said.The Centre and Uttarakhand govt also came under severe criticism for "keeping its eyes shut" on the misdeeds of Patanjali and giving it a long rope despite the company violating the law and claiming to cure incurable diseases including Covid-19 in violation of law.As lawyers of Ramdev and Balkrishna were facing the ire of the court, it was the solicitor general whose intervention came as a relief as he assured the court that as an officer of the court he would sit with them to draft a proper affidavit.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-ceding-island-part-of-congresss-historic-failures/articleshow/108984923.cms|PM Modi: Ceding island part of Congress's 'historic failures'|NEW DELHI: PM Modi Tuesday kept up the attack on Congress and DMK as he linked the Indira Gandhi govt's decision to cede Katchatheevu island in Palk Strait to Sri Lanka in 1974 to Congress' "historic failures" in protecting the country's territorial integrity."Can Congress, which was responsible for division of the country, still talks about dividing the country and gave away Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka, protect the country?" Modi asked in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand, at an election rally.He had attacked Congress on Sunday in Meerut for giving away the island to Sri Lanka.Bringing up the issue in the Rudrapur rally, the PM linked it to the valour of jawans from Uttarakhand who sacrificed their lives to protect the country's borders."Uttarakhand is known for brave mothers, whose brave sons stake their lives for every single inch of the motherland but another startling example about Congress's failures has come to the fore. The issue pertains to Tamil Nadu but people of Uttarakhand should also know about Congress's sins," the PM said."Located near Tamil Nadu, Katchatheevu was a part of India but Congress gave it to Sri Lanka. If Indian fishermen go near the island even by mistake, they're arrested and jailed. Tell me, can Congress, which talks about dividing the country, which give away Katchatheevu island, protect the country?" the PM asked.While the PM led from the front, others in the govt and BJP also went on the attack.Union minister Hardeep Puri said the Congress govt in 1974 ought to have taken Parliament's concurrence while ceding the country's territory. He faulted Congress's ally DMK as well and said, "CM M Karunanidhi concurred with the agreement. But DMK opposed it in Parliament."He said territorial issues were negotiated on principle of "give and take" but in case of Katchatheevu, it was only "give" and no "take", with no effort to secure reciprocal concessions from Sri Lanka.The attacks on Congress came amid a sense of satisfaction in party circles that the revelations about India giving up its claim on the island has led the party to defend Indira Gandhi's 1974 deal: a change from the posture where DMK as well as Congress, at least in Tamil Nadu, had washed their hands off it and would demand that Modi govt take steps to retrieve the island.BJP found support from former foreign secretary Harsh Shringla who said it was strange on the part of the then govt to give in to pressure from Sri Lanka when even the British had recognised the island as part of India and not Ceylon as Sri Lanka was then known. "Nehru was indifferent to the issue and Indira Gandhi gave it to Sri Lanka through the delimitation treaty, which was a historical injustice to the country," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1824836,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It shows their desperation.They have ruled the country for 60 years and just because they have been out of office for 10 years, they are so desperate they are speaking of setting the country on fire," the PM said while opening his poll campaign in Uttarakhand. He asked people to ensure a wipeout of Congress "Will you allow the country to be set on fire?" he said.Will you allow the country to be set on fire? Is this language acceptable? Is this the language of democracy? Shouldn't you punish people who say such things? Congress, which has an Emergency-era mentality, has lost faith in democracy and is now trying to incite people against the results, Modi said about Rahul Gandhi's remark.Addressing the 'Loktantra Bachao' rally of INDIA bloc parties in Delhi on Sunday, Rahul had said if BJP secured victory through "match-fixing" in the Lok Sabha polls and altered the Constitution, the country would be on fire and wouldn't survive. The rally also saw Modi strongly pitching for the Citizenship Amendment Act and berating Congress for opposing it . "Our govt introduced CAA to grant citizenship to those loyal to 'Bharat Mata', which is causing the most concern for Congress," Modi said, adding that the majority of refugees who had come from Bangladesh and Pakistan were Dalits, Sikhs and Bengali families. "Congress, which facilitates infiltrators, is now opposing CAA," he said.Stating that people of Uttarakhand could not forget that Congress had insulted a brave son of the nation, the first Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, he said, "Such a party cannot be expected to have patriotism."Referring to Congress MP from Karnataka D K Suresh's comment that people of south India might have to demand a separate country if there was injustice in giving them their rightful share of taxes, Modi said, "Instead of punishing such people, Congress rewards them by giving them tickets to contest polls."The PM said action against the corrupt would go on and he would not be deterred by threats and abuses. "Don't you think the corrupt should go to jail? The corrupt are threatening and abusing me. But they can't deter me. Action against each one of the corrupt persons will continue," he added.He also highlighted the achievements of his party over the last decade, referring to it as a "preview" of what's to come in his third term. "When intentions are right, such work happens naturally. That's why I say, 'neeyat sahi toh nateeje sahi' (if intentions are right, the results are also good)," he said."In the third term, your son will do one more big task. To ensure you get 24-hour electricity, zero electricity bill and earn money from electricity, Modi has started 'Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana'," the PM said, adding that govt was providing assistance to people to set up solar power panels on their rooftops under the scheme. Households consuming 300 units of power on an average would not only get it free but could also earn by selling surplus solar power to govt, he further said.Claiming "unprecedented" development in Uttarakhand over the last decade, Modi said the achievements had surpassed those of the last 65 years. "On the lines of Kedarkhand, we are developing Manaskhand in Uttarakhand. The state's integration into modern connectivity is due to BJP govt's initiatives such as providing 85,000 pucca houses to the poor, water connections to over 12 lakh homes and constructing over 5 lakh toilets," he added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984713,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1149653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

On Wednesday, the court will hear Kejriwal's petition challenging his arrest in the money laundering case.The agency opposed any relief and said the CM "is the kingpin and key conspirator of the Delhi excise scam in collusion with ministers of Delhi Govt, AAP leaders and other persons".He was directly involved in the formulation of the Excise Policy 2021-22, it claimed.ED latched on to Kejriwal's submission when he argued in person before the trial court that he didn't oppose ED's plea for custody. "In light of the above submission made by the petitioner that he has no objection to the custody/remand being extended further, the petitioner has waived his right to question his custody as on today and he cannot now be allowed to argue that his custody as on today is illegal," the agency stated.ED said the Delhi CM "intentionally disobeyed" its nine summonses and did not join the investigation based on "one flimsy ground and another." The agency further said that statements of various persons engaged in the election campaign-related activities by AAP in Goa revealed that cash payments were made to them for their work done as survey workers, area managers, assembly managers, etc."These persons and activities related to the election campaign were overall managed by Vijay Nair and Durgesh Pathak, AAP, MLA in Delhi. This shows the dissipation/utilisation of proceeds of crime by the representative of Manish Sisodia in Goa elections," ED claimed in the reply.The agency further stated there was "irrefutable evidence that Rs 45 crore cash was moved through Hawala from various channels (all linked to the South group) to the AAP's Goa campaign."The petition is listed for hearing before Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma on Wednesday.Last month, the high court had refused to grant interim relief to Kejriwal, saying the matter raised important issues that cannot be "summarily" decided without seeking the agency's stand and had asked ED to file its reply to the challenge to his arrest and the subsequent remand to the ED's custody.In the reply, ED further said after filing of the present petition, the petitioner was further remanded to its custody by way of a well-reasoned and detailed remand order till April 1 when he was subsequently sent to judicial custody by the trial court, which was not opposed by his counsel.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984682,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29004,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In response to an RTI application, SBI has refused to share the information citing the “exemption” clause of the Right To Information Act. SBI has stated that the SOP was only meant for “internal circulation”.Transparency activist Anjali Bhardwaj in her RTI application dated March 4 sought a copy of the SOPs issued by SBI related to electoral bonds since April 2017.In its response dated March 30 (TOI has a copy), SBI has said, “SOPs of Electoral Bond Scheme-2018 issued to authorised branches from time to time are internal guidelines with regard to sale and redemption of electoral bonds (meant for internal circulation only), which is exempted under Section 8(1)(d) of The Right to Information Act, 2005.”Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act states: “Information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.”Not satisfied with the response Bhardwaj will be filing an appeal. Bhardwaj in a statement on Tuesday said “The SBI has blandly invoked the exemption clause without demonstrating how the disclosure would “harm the competitive position of a third party”. The denial will be challenged in appeal.“Given the lack of clarity over the manner in which SBI recorded data on transactions through Electoral Bonds (EBs), a copy of the SOP was sought under the RTI Act,” Bhardwaj added in the statement.“It is shocking to note that even after the Supreme Court has struck down the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional and has explicitly directed and ensured disclosure of all details of EBs purchased and redeemed, the SBI continues to deny important information about the operation of the electoral bonds scheme,” Bhardwaj asserted.On why the SOP is crucial, Bhardwaj said that it would reveal the official instructions governing the particulars of information that were to be stored, and the form and manner in which information was to be maintained by SBI on the sale and redemption of EBs.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1504345,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

I have categorically told him that I will not withdraw.”A defiant Eshwarappa said he explained to the union home minister, in detail, the reasons for his contest in the fray from Shivamogga.“I made four points to Shah in our telephonic conversation when he asked as to why I was contesting despite me being such a senior politician in the party. I told him that the Karnataka BJP was going the way of the Congress party with dynastic politics on the rise with the state unit in the hands of one family, that of B S Yediyurappa.With Yediyurappa being personally in the central parliamentary board, one son being an MP in B Y Raghavendra and his second son B Y Vijayendra becoming the party state president, it has hurt a lot of the party cadre who have built the party and worked for the party, ” he said.Eshwarappa reminded that the prime minister Narendra Modi had been seeking the rejection of the same dynastic politics which is practiced in the opposition parties .Secondly, he said that loyal party workers who had firm belief in the Hindutva agenda, myself, C T Ravi, Ananth Kumar Hegde, Basangouda Patil Yatnal, D V Sadananda Gowda and Pratap Simha have all been sidelined and cadre expressing their core ideology are fearing whether they are in the wrong.The third point, which Eshwarappa claimed he told Shah was that the entire state cadre are disappointed with the dynastic politics and there was a need to set things right as a result of which he was contesting.“The fourth point I made was that in the entire state there was grave injustice made towards the other backward communities (OBC) by being denied tickets. I have been receiving calls from across the state. As a result of this I am contesting polls,” he added.Eshwarappa then added that Shah asked him to consider the political future of his son, to which the former said that he had taken his son into confidence before taking his decision.“Finally, Shah has asked me to come to Delhi and I have agreed to meet him as they are our party senior leadership. I have told him that even if I come to Delhi, I urge you to not ask me to withdraw from the elections,” said Eshwarappa.The former deputy chief minister said he will be meeting Shah on Tuesday evening.Later in the day, Shah chaired the BJP-JD(S) core committee meeting and asked both the parties state leaders to ensure that Congress does not win a single seat.He is said to have commissioned a coordination committee at every Parliamentary seat level to ensure that campaigning is conducted jointly and smoothly at the local level.Shah also chaired the core committee meeting of the Davangere, Chitradurga, Tumakuru and Chikkaballapura Lok Sabha segments leaders and senior functionaries.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983446,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22920,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The development took place days after the BJP moved the election officers, seeking withdrawal of his security cover.According to police, Prakash Das , Srikant Pakal and Pradip Pradhan shared a letter with journalists at a press conference here recently, claiming that they received it through the RTI from the commissionerate police.The undated letter, which carried the logo of the commissionerate police, claimed that Pandian enjoyed security cover provided by 74 police personnel. The trio alleged that such a deployment exceeds the prescribed allocation even for individuals entitled to Z+ security, which typically warrants a contingent of 55 personnel.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Prateek Singh denied any such letter, which was circulated by the trio at the press conference, was ever issued by the police. “We completely disown the letter, which was forged and fabricated.

He also claimed that great injustice has been done to Hemant.“BJP-led forces may have succeeded in putting him behind bars but the tribals of Jharkhand will show the Bharatiya Janata Party the exit door in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. We are more than confident of winning all 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state," Champai Soren said.Meanwhile, Sita Soren, who joined the BJP earlier this month, has launched an all-out attack against her family members. Sita has alleged "continued neglect and isolation" by the JMM and has also claimed that Hemant Soren's wife Kalpana had "insulted" her.Sita is the wife of Shibu Soren's elder son Durga Soren who died in 2009. She has now demanded high-level probe into the "mysterious death" of her husband."The change that came in our lives after my husband's death was no less than a nightmare. We were neglected and isolated socially and politically," Sita has claimed.Launching a scathing attack on JMM, Sita accused the party of "deviating from its principle and indulging in corruption".For the JMM, selecting a candidate for Dumka could be a tough call.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/j-k-rowling-challenges-scottish-hate-crime-law-uk-govt-comes-out-in-her-support/articleshow/108984475.cms|J K Rowling challenges Scottish hate crime law, UK govt comes out in her support|(Reuters and NYT) LONDON: The British govt said J K Rowling should not be arrested for her transgender views after the Harry Potter author challenged Scotland's new hate crime law with social media posts asserting that a number of trans women were men.Rowling, a prominent gender critical campaigner, made the comments on Monday, the day that the crime of "stirring up hatred" relating to age, disability, religion, sexual orientation and transgender identity came into effect.A conviction could lead to a fine and a prison sentence of up to seven years.The new hate crime law has also faced criticism over its impact on freedom of speech and concerns that it could be used to silence some views, including from those who advocate for women-only spaces.Rowling tested the law by listing 10 trans women, including a convicted rapist, sex abusers and high profile activists, on X and saying they were men. "Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal," she said. "I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment."When asked about the criticism, Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf said the bill was about "protecting people from a rising tide of hatred". "It is not Twitter police. It is not activists, it is not the media. It is not, thank goodness, even politicians who decide ultimately whether or not crime has been committed," Yousaf said. He said it would be up to "the police to investigate, and the threshold for criminality is incredibly high." "Unless your behaviour is threatening and intends to stir up hatred, then you have nothing to worry."Police Scotland said it had received complaints in relation to Rowling's post. "(But) The comments are not assessed to be criminal and no further action will be taken," it said.Earlier, PM Rishi Sunak said Britain had a proud tradition of free speech and that the new law had given the police the wrong priorities.

Government supporters took to the streets and called for retaliation against Israel.The strike, on part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, killed three generals in Iran's Quds Force and four other officers, making it one of the deadliest attacks of the yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran.Raisi said it was an "inhumane assault in brazen violation of international law," in comments reported by Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency. He added that it will not go unanswered, but gave no details of how Iran might respond.Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said in an earlier post on X that Iran had summoned the Swiss ambassador after midnight local time and asked that an important message be delivered to Washington: That as Israel's ally, the "US must answer" for Israel's actions. Switzerland acts as the US' representative in the absence of diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington. The spokesman for the leadership of Iran's parliament, Seyyed Nezamoldin Mousavi, told Iranian state media that "an appropriate response is a national request by the people of Iran."In Washington, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that "the US had no involvement in the strike" and "did not know about it ahead of time". A US official said a statement had been communicated directly to Iran.In several cities across Iran, including Tehran, large crowds gathered waving Palestinian and Iranian flags and demanding revenge. "Death to Israel" and "Death to America" chanted the crowds, warning that if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared jihad against Israel, then "no army can hold us back."The UNSC will hold an emergency meeting later on Tuesday to discuss Israel's attack. Russia, a close ally of Iran, requested the meeting. Iran's UN ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a letter to the world body that the attack on diplomatic buildings was a violation of international law.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-743426,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

NEW YORK: Donald Trump hit out Tuesday at a New York judge for extending a gag order preventing the former US president from attacking those involved in his upcoming hush money trial , calling it "election interference".On Monday, the judge presiding over Trump's trial for allegedly making pre-election payments to a porn star expanded the gag order against him to include comments about family members of the magistrate and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.The move came after the Republican presidential candidate lashed out at Judge Juan Merchan and his daughter in a series of posts on Truth Social."I just was informed that another corrupt New York Judge, Juan Merchan, GAGGED me so that I can not talk about the corruption and conflicts taking place in his courtroom," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform."They can talk about me, but I can't talk about them??? That sounds fair, doesn't it?"This Judge should be recused, and the case should be thrown out.In his order on Monday, Merchan said Trump's "pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose.""It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, that not only they, but their family members as well, are 'fair game' for defendant's vitriol."Trump faces charges of falsifying business records for payments made by his lawyer Michael Cohen on the eve of the 2016 presidential election to porn star Stormy Daniels to make sure she did not publicize a sexual encounter.The case will kick off on April 15, and is the first ever criminal trial of a former president.Asked by reporters if he would take the witness stand, Trump has said he "would have no problem testifying."Trump now has four criminal indictments to his name and faces 88 felony counts for a wide variety of alleged criminality.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108981995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The British Indian leader made a statement about the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, which came in force on Monday and led Rowling to issue a sharp rebuke on social media warning against the "dangers of eliminating women's and girls' single-sex spaces".The law creates a new crime of "stirring up hatred" relating to protected characteristics."People should not be criminalised for stating simple facts on biology. We believe in free speech in this country, and Conservatives will always protect it," Sunak said in a statement.In a series of social media posts on Monday, Rowling - a vocal defender of women's only spaces when being balanced with the rights of transexuals - referenced several transgender women as men, including convicted prisoners, trans activists and other public figures. The award-winning Scottish author, who lives in Edinburgh, then invited police to arrest her if they believed she had committed an offence under the new law."I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment," writes Rowling on X, formerly Twitter.Rowling, 58, said the members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who voted for the new hate crime laws had "placed higher value on the feelings of men performing their idea of femaleness, however misogynistically or opportunistically, than on the rights and freedoms of actual women and girls".Humza Yousaf, the Pakistani-origin First Minister of Scotland who was justice minister in the Scottish National Party (SNP) led government when the bill was passed in the Scottish Parliament Holyrood in 2021, was targeted with Islamophobic graffiti near his home in Dundee in the wake of the new law being enforced. However, he insisted it was a reminder of why such a law is needed to ensure a "zero-tolerance approach to hatred".Police Scotland is investigating the graffiti and said "inquiries are ongoing".Meanwhile, hundreds gathered outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to protest against the new hate crime law for its restrictions on freedom of speech. They waved placards reading: "Truth is not hate speech" and "Protect free speech".The new laws were developed following an Independent Review of Hate Crime Legislation, which concluded that new specific offences relating to stirring up hatred were needed.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980781,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-956627,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

During the proceedings of the 190 million pound Toshakhana corruption case at Adiala Jail, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader informed Judge Nasir Javed Rana about an alleged poisoning attempt on the former first lady.The PTI leader stated that the former first lady exhibited marks on her skin and tongue as purported side effects of the alleged "poisoning"."I know who is behind it," said the 71-year-old PTI founder.He emphasised that if any harm came to Bushra, the Pakistan Army chief (General Asim Munir) should be held responsible as members of an intelligence agency were controlling everything at his Bani Gala residence in Islamabad and Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.During the hearing of the 190 million pound Toshakhana corruption case at Adiala Jail, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader raised concerns about the health of 49-year-old Bushra, the former first lady. He urged the court to order her medical examination by Dr. Asim of Shaukat Khanum Hospital, citing distrust in the doctor who previously examined her.Additionally, he called for an inquiry into the alleged poisoning incident. Responding to the request, the court directed Khan to submit a detailed application regarding Bushra's medical examination.Speaking to the media after the hearing, Bushra addressed rumors circulating within the party, alleging that she was poisoned with a popular toilet cleaner. She claimed that three drops of the cleaner were added to her food, resulting in various health issues such as swollen eyes, chest and stomach pain, and bitterness in food and water. However, she refused to disclose the identity of the person who informed her about the poisoning.Bushra informed the court that although she was treated decently at the Bani Gala sub-jail, she was restricted from opening the windows for some time.Earlier, the PTI had claimed that Bushra was given poisonous food during her incarceration, causing her severe pain. They expressed concerns about her life being endangered and criticized the denial of her constitutional right to a medical examination. Furthermore, they alleged that Bushra's family was barred from visiting her, which they considered a violation of both the Constitution and jail regulations.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana corruption case involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during Khan's tenure. While Khan was held at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, Bushra was placed under house arrest at Khan's Bani Gala residence, which was declared a sub-jail.The PTI emphasised that Bushra had no connection to the corruption case and accused authorities of pressuring Khan through her conviction.Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan condemned the alleged political victimization of Bushra, expressing concerns about her isolation and potential poisoning. He warned of holding accountable those responsible for any harm to her.Since his ousting from power through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has faced convictions in multiple cases, including the cipher case.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-836421,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

We don't know where they are if they are with the attackers or in the bush," he told Reuters.Pochalla County is mostly inhabited by the Anyuak ethnic group. They and the Murle, who mainly live in neighbouring Boma County, have fought sporadically and the violence, partly motivated by cattle rustling, has involved ethnic groups from neighbouring Jonglei State.In late March, youths shot dead 15 people in Pibor, including Boma's deputy army commander, government officials and the county commissioner's bodyguards.Officials also blamed the youths for the killing last year of another county commissioner in Pibor and a security official.More than 150 people were killed earlier this year during conflicts between rival groups in northern and western South Sudan.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108974911,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-514233,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-can-eu-support-philippines-in-south-china-sea-dispute/articleshow/108974162.cms|How can EU support Philippines in South China Sea dispute?|Europe condemns Chinese aggression What is Europe's status in the South China Sea? What are Europe's options? NEW DELHI: Last week, China's coast guard shot a water cannon at a Philippine boat on a supply mission to an outpost on Second Thomas Shoal , injuring crew members and damaging the small vessel.Large Chinese vessels frequently harass Filipino boats near the shoal, which has become a flashpoint in a long-running maritime dispute in the South China Sea between Beijing and Manila.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has warned his government would take "proportionate, deliberate" action against "dangerous attacks by agents of the China coast guard and Chinese maritime militia."On March 25, after the water cannon assault, Manila lodged its "strongest protest" yet against Beijing and summoned a senior Chinese diplomat.China claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea as its territory, despite an international tribunal ruling in 2016 that such claims are unlawful. These territorial tensions are particularly high with the Philippines, as China claims several shoals and reefs that are within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).To back up its claim to Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines maintains an outpost on a navy transport ship, the Sierra Madre, which is intentionally grounded on the reef, and is manned by a group of marines.China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian responded that Chinese vessels "continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests."The Chinese embassy in Manila warned the Philippines against "playing with fire."This latest attack has also drawn international outcry. The US reaffirmed an "ironclad commitment" to help defend its long-standing Philippine ally.The European Union also joined in to condemn China's actions in a strongly worded statement released on March 23."The succession of repeated dangerous maneuvers, blocking and water cannoning" by the Chinese coast guard and maritime militia against Philippine vessels "constituted a dangerous provocation against the Philippines vessels.""These acts put human lives at risk, undermine regional stability and international norms, and threaten security in the region and beyond," it added.Eleven European states also issued statements of support for the Philippines and criticized China.Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales, told DW that the recent critical response by the EU and individual member states was "unprecedented," but not "unexpected," as Europe has an important stake in maintaining stability in waterways that are critical to global trade.Over the past year, the US has strongly reiterated that it would fulfill its obligation to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if China was to attack the Philippine military. However, the European position is more opaque.Since 2022, the Philippines has signed new defense agreements with the EU and the UK, while France is hoping to ink a visiting forces agreement to allow its troops access to Philippine military bases.The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have deployed naval warships to the South China Sea for freedom of navigation exercises (FONOPs) in recent years, while Italy is reportedly planning to send its flagship aircraft carrier "Cavour" to the region later this year.In mid-March, EU special envoy to the Indo-Pacific region Richard Tibbels said that European states want to conduct port calls and joint naval exercises with the Philippines as part of a plan to have a more coordinated maritime presence "further east in the Indo-Pacific region.""We really have a strong interest in making sure that freedom of navigation and overflight continues and that the global trading system is not affected by increasing tensions in the region," Tibbels told the Associated Press this month.However, the Philippines has no treaty alliance with a European state, while most analysts are skeptical about whether European navies would be able to assist the Southeast Asian country in the event of a conflict with China.The EU "does not have enough military means to deter the use of force nor to weigh decisively on the course of events should a conflict erupt in the region," said Mathieu Droin, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Nonetheless, the EU does have some economic leverage over China and other Southeast Asian states, Droin told DW.Alexander Vuving, professor at the Daniel K Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, said that tensions in the South China Sea are not just playing out "in the physical domain but also in the cognitive domain."Vuving is referring to Beijing's so-called "three warfares," which include psychological warfare, public opinion warfare and lawfare."While geography disadvantages European countries regarding China's 'people's war at sea,' European countries actually have a large capacity in fighting China's 'three warfares,'" Vuving said.Analysts reckon that Europe can deter Beijing by forging closer economic bonds with the Philippines, and by publicly supporting Manila when the Philippines is aggressed by China, as the EU did this week. Both moves can make Beijing more aware of the growing importance of ties with the Philippines for policymakers in Brussels.On March 18, the EU and the Philippines agreed to resume talks over a free trade agreement that had stalled in 2017 over European complaints about human rights violations committed by the government of then-President Rodrigo Duterte.Relations have massively improved since Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the country's former dictator, became president in 2022 and repositioned Manila much closer to the West, after his predecessor's dalliance with Beijing.And there appears to be a consensus forming in China that Europeans are being pulled closer into the South China Sea disputes by Manila.A recent editorial by Zhu Feng, director of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University, published in the Global Times, China's state-run tabloid, claimed that the Philippines is acting as the victim "to sway European countries" and to encourage European and NATO members to "intervene in the dispute."However, while tensions are heating up, most analysts do not expect a full-scale conflict between China and the Philippines in the foreseeable future.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108974351,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-956488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Mayorships in Mexico often included smaller surrounding communities. The authorities were not authorized to be quoted by name.Video of the scene posted on social media showed a small procession of people shouting "Morena!" - the name of Gaytan's party. At that moment, several shots can be heard and people are seen running and falling down.It was the latest killing in the increasingly bloody runup to Mexico's June 2 elections. At least 14 candidates have been killed since the start of 2024.Morena is the party of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leaves office in September.

He said such an attempt would be futile and that the response to any North Korean aggression would be firm.Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation.On Tuesday, aircraft from the three countries conducted air drills that involved a US B-52H strategic bomber to enhance deterrence and counter capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from the North, South Korea said.Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations.South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a Nato summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108971575,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1171479,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Tasked with this critical role by President Vladimir Putin, Nabiullina has orchestrated an economic strategy that not only navigates through the immediate crises but also sets the stage for long-term resilience and stability.Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict and the ensuing Western sanctions, Nabiullina's expertise has been crucial in mitigating the impact on Russia's financial system.Her approach has involved implementing controls and measures to stabilize the ruble and manage inflation, despite the global pressures and economic isolation faced by Russia, a report in Insider said.Under Nabiullina's leadership, the Central Bank of Russia has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to shield the economy. This includes increasing interest rates to curb inflation, introducing capital controls to prevent a currency collapse, and developing internal markets to reduce dependency on Western financial systems. Her actions have been instrumental in ensuring that the Russian economy remains functional, despite significant challenges.Nabiullina's dedication to her role and her strategic acumen have earned her respect both within Russia and internationally. As a key figure in Russia's economic policy, her efforts to engineer a wartime economy capable of withstanding external pressures highlight the complexity of global economic interactions in the modern age.Her work reflects a nuanced understanding of the geopolitical landscape and the intricacies of economic governance during times of conflict.

The crash , which happened around noon, led to the SUV crumpling against the barrier, surrounded by tactical vehicles. The FBI Atlanta confirmed that after the crash, the suspect exited the vehicle on foot and attempted to enter the facility.Special agents nearby apprehended the suspect shortly after he exited his vehicle. The FBI is currently assessing state and federal charges.Video evidence of the SUV being towed away emerged by late afternoon. The driver's identity remains undisclosed, but media reports suggest the individual was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta for evaluation. DeKalb Police, responding to the scene at 3000 Flowers Drive, are working towards securing warrants for the suspect involved in striking the gate at the FBI Office.During a televised press conference, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Peter Ellis shared that the driver attempted to follow an employee into the facility before hitting the closing barricade. However, when asked about the possibility of this being a terrorist attack, Ellis stated he couldn't confirm any indications of such motives at this point.FBI Atlanta has announced that there is "no clear motive" behind the crash.

However, passengers whose flights have been cancelled or delayed have learnt that these norms do not address some of their core concerns.For instance: For a flight cancellation done within 24 hours of departure, the norms state that the airline should either provide an alternative flight or refund the ticket and pay compensation ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, depending on the length of the journey.For passengers who are not accommodated on an alternative flight, this compensation amount hardly covers the costs they would have to incur in buying a last-minute ticket to their destination.On Tuesday, Sushil Patni and his wife, both senior citizens, ended up spending Rs 21,000 to book tickets on IndiGo to fly to Delhi from Indore after Vistara cancelled their flight. They were booked on an evening departure to Baku and so could not wait for a day for alternative arrangements. Under the said norms, together they would get a compensation of Rs 15,000.Then again, the provisions mention free hotel accommodation only in case of flight delay, and not for cancellations. It states that the airline is required to provide meals and refreshments, an alternative flight/full refund of ticket to the passenger or hotel accommodation, including transfers, depending on the total flight delay. Airlines must provide hotel accommodation only if the delay is more than 24 hours or more than six hours for flights scheduled to depart between 8pm and 3am.Passengers have been pointing these deficiencies out on social media.Sanjay Gupta posted on X that his daughters were booked on a flight from Mopa-Goa to Delhi. "The flight has been delayed many times...daughters are still stuck there. Vistara said, take a refund. What will they do then?".Vamshi Papatla, an X user, posted that he spent Rs 2,400 on cab rides to and from Hyderabad and lost the money paid for a hotel booking in Mumbai after the airline cancelled his Hyderabad-Mumbai flight.Sachin Chhabra, another passenger, posted on X: "Who will bear our hotel and other bookings expenses in case Vistara cancels our flight at the last moment?"|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985380,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1148649,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/60-vistara-flights-cancelled-regulator-seeks-daily-updates/articleshow/108985227.cms|60+ Vistara flights cancelled, regulator seeks daily updates|DGCA: Vistara flight disruptions due to crew unavailability NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) on Tuesday asked crisis-hit Vistara to provide it with daily information on flight cancellations and delays and to extend flyers all facilities due to them, along with refunds and compensation. The development came on a day that saw the airline cancelling more than 60 flights, after almost 50 on Monday, as reported by TOI.Vistara has a daily schedule of over 350 domestic and international flights.On Tuesday, from Mumbai alone, the airline cancelled 14 departures and 17 arrivals. On international routes, flights from Mumbai to Paris and Male were cancelled. Passengers booked on connecting international flights out of Delhi and Mumbai were worst hit. Kolkata had one cancellation and several delays. The airline has yet to issue a statement.On-time performance (OTP) of Vistara's currently operating flights has nosedived because of an ongoing pilot shortage . On Monday, just 51% of the airline's domestic flights had been on time, according to data on the aviation ministry website."We are monitoring the situation to ensure compliance and minimise passenger inconvenience," said a senior DGCA official.DGCA says Vistara has been seeing flight disruptions "due to various reasons, including crew unavailability". While pilots remain dissatisfied over "pay cuts" they will have to endure when the airline merges with Air India, and for other reasons, sources in Vistara say they hope the issue will be resolved by this week. "Our Tuesday OTP was much better than Monday's, though there still are some delays. As far as pilots being unhappy over being shifted from a minimum payment of 70 hours to 40 hours per month (under the new agreement they had to sign as Vistara prepares for the merger) is concerned, they will actually make more than before as utilisation is more than 70 hours for active pilots," said a source.Vistara operations returning to normal is crucial for this capacity-constrained peak summer travel season. Already, passengers now looking to either rebook on other airlines or making fresh bookings while avoiding Vistara are complaining of fares spiking. For instance, the cheapest economy ticket on budget carriers flying from Bengaluru to Delhi on April 6 and flying back on April 14 starts from upwards of Rs 25,000 and goes up to Rs 46,000, searches on online travel agencies show."I was asleep when the airline messaged late at night that our 8.20am flight from Indore to Delhi had been cancelled," said Sushil Patni, a senior citizen travelling with his wife to Azerbaijan. "We then booked the 10am IndiGo flight to Chandigarh, from where we flew to Delhi, as were booked on the 9pm flight to Baku. We ended up spending over Rs 21,000 for the last-minute IndiGo flight to Delhi via Chandigarh."With almost 75 IndiGo planes grounded because of snag-ridden Pratt & Whitney engines, GoAir not flying since last May, SpiceJet operating few flights, and supply of new planes being slower than promised from both Boeing and Airbus, the Vistara crisis could not have at a worse time, just ahead of the peak summer travel season.Vistara has a schedule to operate 2,324 weekly domestic flights this summer, 25% more than last summer's 1,856. A dip in this will add to the ongoing shortage amid runaway demand and could lead to skyrocketing airfares.Aware of the heartburn this could cause in the busy poll season, the aviation ministry on Tuesday said it was monitoring the situation of Vistara flight cancellations.Analysing what's going wrong, senior pilots in AI and Vistara said introduction of the new wage agreement for Vistara pilots was not done properly. "There was no consideration of seniority and experience for staff in the merged entity. The pilots were not consulted. Some in the senior management don't have adequate experience and maturity to handle the complicated process of merger Crew scheduling has not considered adequate fatigue and lifestyle management," said a senior pilot.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108985259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1487272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

As per projection, this will touch 89,900 km by 2037 and 1.27 lakh km by 2047.The setting up of CMU, which will focus on end-to-end management of NH stretches, is crucial considering that the highway development is likely to reach a saturation level in the next 14-15 years and NHAI staff need to be trained for operation and maintenance of the stretches.The road transport ministry is readying the major organisational reforms and completing processes of consultations for both strengthening of NHAI and restructuring of NHIDCL, an entity responsible for highway development in hilly and north-eastern states. Sources said during the current poll season, infrastructure ministries, including road and housing ministries are making good use of time in completing the preparatory works so that work can start at full speed after the new govt takes charge in June.They added that the housing and urban affairs ministry is completing the process of roll out of different flagship programmes such as PM e-Bus Scheme and finalisation of the Delhi Master Plan. Sources said top PMO officials have also been holding regular review meetings on infrastructure projects and they are also visiting some of the sites.TOI has learnt that in its presentation to the PMO, the road transport ministry has proposed strengthening NHAI considering that it plans to bid out another 60,555 km of NHs for development. “After 14-15 years, our focus will be more on managing the stretches and maintenance and we have to get ready for this,” a source said.The ministry has proposed increasing the sanctioned staff strength, especially in technical posts to meet the work requirement in the next 13-15 years and to increase the NHAI permanent cadre to 90% of the total sanction to “build continuity and deep expertise” in road management. In the current regime, half of the employees are on deputation.The ministry has flagged that staff on deputation typically serve for a fixed term before returning to their parent organisations and this leads to a lack of long-term commitment to NHAI’s projects and goals. It has said that projects requiring long-term oversight suffer from discontinuity. The ministry has also pointed to the problem of limited accountability in case of default or non-compliance as there is limitation on disciplinary action to be taken on staff on deputation.In the case of NHIDCL, the ministry has pointed to how the entity has no regular cadre and the deputation scheme is not attracting enough talent. Moreover, employees on contract are being filled with retired govt personnel only and there is no provision for professionals to be taken on lateral entry basis for fixed tenure contracts.It has proposed having a cadre for the entity with 50% being recruited directly and remaining half on deputation. The ministry has also sought engaging contractual professionals, both retired and from the market, for better functioning of the organisation.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-705834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In a few days, the season will draw to a close after either the 29th or 30th roza. Eid ul' Fitr will be celebrated the following day.Ramzan is the ninth and most important month of the Islamic calendar. It is the promise of All Almighty that fasting is an act performed only for Him and He alone will present the reward of the 'sawm' (Ramzan fast).The month is divided into three 'Ashra's or segments comprising 10 days each, the first promising the Rahmat (mercy) of Allah Almighty, the second Maghfirat (forgiveness) and the third 'Nijaat' (emancipation).The third 'Ashra' brings Ramzan season to full blossom in terms of shopping, feasting and charity. It is then that the most important night of Laylatul' Qadr is believed to fall -- on one of the odd numbered dates, either the 21st, 23rd, 25th or 27th roza.The general belief goes that Shab E' Qadr falls on the night of the 27th roza which is the intervening night of Saturday April 6 and Sunday April 7 this year. Most Muslims, especially those observing the Etikaaf seclusion, intensify prayers this night.As the countdown begins towards Eid ul' Fitr, the imminent separation from the month of blessing is felt keenly. The gentle transition from the pre-dawn Suhoor meal to a regular workday followed by Iftar thanksgiving at sunset, then the special Taraweeh namaz at night will all be missed.Shariq Shaikh, a local businessman from Bandra said, "We settle to a new routine during Ramzan and even tune our shop timings to Iftar and Taraweeh namaz. Many youngsters who fail to pray diligently throughout the year fill the mosques during this holy month."Food is a universal highlight of the season. Residents of the western suburbs have been flocking to savour Ramzan delicacies at an Iftar Bazaar along Jogeshwari SV Road outside the station.A cluster of stalls selling hot kebabs, rolls, fritters, breads, halwa paratha and malpua nestle below the Allah Wali Masjid while others are spread across all the way to Behrambaug Junction.Local vendor Mohammed Sajid said, "In keeping with the spirit of the festival, there is a variety of fare for people of all economic classes and tastes. You will see ten-rupee samosas or kebabs filled with soya or potato -- or spinach and mint with small bits of chicken for Rs 20-25. At the other end of the spectrum there are chicken and mutton kebabs, rolls and rich malpuas costing Rs 100-150 each. A quarter kg of bright orange halwa and hot maida paratha comes for Rs 50. The aim is to ensure that even poor people can fulfil their fast comfortably, and the palate is pleased as well."Meanwhile, needy individuals apart from mosques, madrassas and community NGOs are reinforcing calls for Zakaat donations. Most people opt to offer Zakaat during Ramzan since the reward of each act of piety and prayer is multiplied 70 times.And the mandatory Fitra donation by each fasting individual must be disbursed before men attend the Eid ul' Fitr namaz on the morning of the festival. In olden days its measure was calculated by items like 1.75 kilo of wheat (which was costly since it was scarce), or 3.5 kg of either dates, barley or raisins. Today it is distributed in the cash equivalent.Mosques have released the annual amount of Fitra to be given this year. The Sadaqatul Fitr amount for Ramzan 2024 calculated by Markazul Ma'arif in Jogeshwari is Rs 70 (1.5 kg of wheat) or Rs 140 (3.5 kg barley) or Rs 900 (3.5 kg of dates) or Rs 1,050 (3.5 kg raisins). A fasting Muslim man or woman may choose to donate any of these amounts as per their wish or capacity, but most people choose to pay the best they can.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80730,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Elon Musk 's auto giant reported 386,810 deliveries over the period, reflecting in part a weak sales market in China, where it faces heavy competition from local electric vehicle (EV) makers.The automaker's production slipped about 1.7% to 433,371.Analysts have been girding for a tough first quarter for the high-flying Tesla, which has reportedly cut production in China the face of the rise of BYD and other Chinese automakers.Tesla was also hit in the quarter at its lone European factory in Germany, which was targeted in a suspected arson attack on nearby power lines in early March, denting production.At the same time, an increase in EVs in other markets including the United States has led Tesla to enact price cuts, dimming the company's profit outlook.Still, Tuesday's figures from Tesla disappointed market watchers."While we were anticipating a bad 1Q, this was an unmitigated disaster," said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives."We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative."Shares fell 5.2% in early trading.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980888,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-589405,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The letter said Tesla is between two big growth waves, one from global expansion of the Models 3 and Y, and a second coming from the Model 2, a new smaller and less expensive vehicle.Last year Tesla dramatically lowered U.S. prices by up to $20,000 for some models. In March it temporarily knocked $1,000 off the Model Y, its top-selling vehicle. The reductions cut into the company's profit margins, which spooked investors.Shares of Tesla tumbled 7.4% at Tuesday's opening bell. They have lost about 30% of their value so far this year as Wall Street grew leery of the tremendous growth story that Tesla was telling.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, normally bullish on the stock, wrote in an investor note last week that first-quarter deliveries would be a "nightmare quarter" for Tesla.Ives gave the stock an Outperform rating but cut his one-year price target from $315 to $300.During the quarter, Tesla lost production time in Germany after a suspected arson attack cut its power supply. U.S. production was slowed by an upgrade to the Model 3, and Ives estimated that China sales slid 3% to 4% during the period.Ives wrote that investor patience is starting to wear thin."For Musk, this is a 'fork in the road' time to get Tesla through this turbulent period, otherwise darker days could be ahead," Ives wrote.Softer than expected first-quarter sales is reducing analyst expectations for quarterly earnings when they are released on April 23.

This surge brought the stock above its IPO price of Rs 949, marking a strong recovery for India's largest insurer.According to ET, the stock's remarkable rally came to a stop when the insurer approved a 17% wage increase for its one lakh employees.The wage revision undoubtedly benefits the 1.10 lakh LIC employees. However, the 29 lakh shareholders will be concerned about the company's bottom line. The wage hike could result in an annual implication of approximately Rs 4,000 crore, increasing the total wage bill per year to Rs 29,000 crore.Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, was quoted as saying, “It's important to note that LIC operates on a five-year wage cycle, meaning wage levels are reassessed every five years. In FY2023, LIC made provisions for Rs 2,100 crore for wage hikes, indicating that a significant portion of the expected hike was already factored into its pricing.”He further added that some profit booking within the PSU basket also contributed to the correction.Moreover, LIC shares have surged by 79% over the past year, but experienced a 6% correction in March, bringing the year-to-date gain to 13%.Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research, suggests that the outcome of the front running investigation could impact investor confidence and, consequently, the stock price.LIC, the largest domestic institutional investor in the Indian stock market, made headlines due to its involvement in a front-running case. Sebi confirmed the participation of one of its employees in a case of big client's transactions. Subsequently, LIC terminated the accused employee.Srivastava stated that if the front-running case is substantiated, it could erode investor trust in LIC's governance and transparency, possibly resulting in a decrease in stock value. “The severity of the impact (on the stock) will depend on the final wage hike amount and the outcome of the front-running case investigation.”However, Meena suggests that the case is unlikely to have any significant impact on the share price.Despite short-term uncertainties, industry experts remain optimistic about LIC's long-term prospects. Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President at Master Capital Service, believes that the long-term outlook for the Indian insurance industry is promising. He highlights that heightened awareness of financial security and growing disposable income may drive increased adoption of insurance products, supported by the industry's strong position in the market.Upadhyay suggests that the current levels in the market may offer an opportunity for long-term investors with diversified portfolios, particularly those who recognize the potential of the insurance sector and the solid fundamentals of LIC.Sonam Srivastava believes in the promising future of the Indian insurance sector over the long term. The analyst notes that increasing disposable income and growing awareness of financial security could lead to higher penetration of insurance products. Srivastava highlights LIC's dominant market position, suggesting it could benefit from this growth. However, the analyst emphasizes that factors such as government regulations, competition, and LIC's ability to adapt to market changes will shape its long-term performance.In the short term, Srivastava expects potential volatility in the stock, influenced by market conditions and the resolution of the front-running case. Looking ahead, Srivastava emphasizes that LIC's long-term outlook depends on its capacity to enhance profitability, seize market share, and adapt to evolving industry dynamics. Srivastava advises investors to closely monitor LIC's performance, industry trends, and broader market movements before making investment decisions.Meena maintains a bullish outlook on LIC, considering the recent correction as a favorable buying opportunity. He notes strong business momentum and a significant increase in the market value of equity investments recently. As a result, Swastika Investmart has set a 6-month target of Rs 1,200 for LIC.Global brokerage JPMorgan upgraded LIC to overweight from neutral in March and raised the target price to Rs 1,340 from Rs 690 previously.Among domestic firms, Kotak Equities raised its target price for the stock from Rs 1,040 to Rs 1,300, while Emkay Global increased its target to Rs 1,200.

Top things we know so far|So, why is Vistara cancelling flights? It seems that the root cause of the Vistara flight cancellations and delays stems from a crisis within Vistara, primarily due to a shortage of pilots. Reports suggest that pilots are protesting against the terms of a new contract introduced by the airline ahead of its merger with Air India. This protest has resulted in pilots collectively taking sick leave, prompted by concerns over the revised salary structure proposed by Vistara. Unlike other airlines like IndiGo, where sick leave can be taken throughout the year, Vistara pilots are required to utilize their sick leave entitlements by the end of March. Consequently, many pilots have opted to take sick leave simultaneously, resulting in disruptions to flight operations. What is the Ministry of Civil Aviation and DGCA doing? Why are Vistara pilots upset? Vistara pilots are expressing dissatisfaction with the terms of a new contract set to take effect in April. Under the revised agreement, pilots will receive a fixed salary for 40 hours instead of the previous 70 hours, in line with a standardized salary structure across Tata group airlines. This change is expected to negatively impact the earnings of several first officers. airlines. This change is expected to negatively impact the earnings of several first officers. Worries among pilots also revolve around potential implications for their seniority, a critical factor for career advancement post-merger. Seniority, determined by a pilot's length of service with a specific airline, influences various aspects such as base preference, aircraft assignment, and career progression. Despite assurances regarding the establishment of a unified seniority list, there is uncertainty among Vistara pilots about retaining their seniority post-merger, particularly as Air India has been actively recruiting pilots. Vistara Issues Ultimatum to Pilots Vistara flight cancellations: Vistara, the joint venture airline between Tata and SIA, faced significant disruptions today, with nearly 50 flights cancelled and substantial delays in over 150 flights across its network. In response, the airline has announced plans to reduce flight operations and deploy wide-body aircraft on domestic routes to manage the backlog of affected passengers.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has instructed Vistara to provide daily updates on flight cancellations and delays.Additionally, the regulator has mandated the airline to adhere to regulations concerning passenger facilities during denied boarding, flight cancellations, and delays, including provisions for refunds and compensation. Vistara is required to furnish this information to the DGCA as well.Ministry of Civil Aviation has said that it is monitoring the situation of Vistara flight cancellations. “However, flight operations are managed by Airlines themselves. Airlines have to comply with DGCA norms to ensure passenger facilitation in case of cancellation or delay of flights,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation has said.Also Read   Vistara flight disruptions: DGCA steps in, asks airline to submit daily reports & take care of customers The Vistara management had issued a warning to pilots, stating that failure to accept the new contract by the end of March 15 would result in forfeiting a one-time payout and indicate disinterest in joining Air India post-merger, according to documents reviewed by ET.Acknowledging the recent flight disruptions, jointly owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, Vistara issued a statement yesterday, citing cancellations and delays due to crew unavailability. The airline spokesperson assured ongoing efforts to address the challenges and apologized for any inconvenience caused to passengers.The airline is currently undergoing a merger with Air India after its privatization, with Singapore Airlines acquiring a 25.1% stake in the previously state-controlled carrier.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international/us/us-challenges-russia-to-step-back-from-ukraine-attack/articleshow/89654761.cms|US challenges Russia to step back from Ukraine attack|WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine , dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-89654736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70148,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international/us/the-heat-stays-on-earth-hits-6th-warmest-year-on-record/articleshow/88883324.cms|The heat stays on: Earth hits 6th warmest year on record|NEW YORK: Earth simmered to the sixth hottest year on record in 2021, according to several newly released temperature measurements.And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating.Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020.Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018.Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat."So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward."Gavin Schmidt , the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville.There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure."I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them."The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth.The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study."Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann , a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist.The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data.North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello , 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-88883349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37658,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international/us/fda-plans-to-allow-12-to-15-year-olds-to-receive-pfizer-boosters/articleshow/88605028.cms|FDA plans to allow 12- to 15-year-olds to receive pfizer boosters|WASHINGTON: The Food and Drug Administration is planning to broaden eligibility for coronavirus vaccine booster shots, allowing 12- to 15-year-olds to receive third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.Regulators are also expected to authorize an extra shot of Pfizer ’s vaccine for both adolescents and adults five months after receiving a second dose, instead of the current interval of six months.Younger children , ages 5 to 11, with immune deficiencies would be able to receive booster shots as well.The decision to expand the use of the shots would come just as schools prepare to open after the holiday break and as governments around the world try to respond to the fast-spreading omicron variant. Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden ’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA ’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-88605280,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international/us/us-prisons-face-staff-shortages-as-officers-quit-amid-covid/articleshow/87462725.cms|US prisons face staff shortages as officers quit amid COVID|NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become.On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care."All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation.In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him."I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that."Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem.There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons."When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages."Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have."There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough."Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say.In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls.The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers.Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons."Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues.Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown."If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers."A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons."Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems.Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing.Dr. Homer Venters , a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows."Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-87463100,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda."Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams , co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward."Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled. Jefferson 's place in U.S. history is complex.Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved.Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85564910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34088,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international/us/us-house-democrats-face-test-of-unity-on-joe-biden-spending-plans/articleshow/85564106.cms|US House Democrats face test of unity on Joe Biden spending plans|WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85564149,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."The Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85485910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38298,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock departed soon, lofting Reece Topley to Dagar at long-on.The LSG were 143 for four in 16.3 overs at that stage and needed a few more runs to reach safer shores.Pooran, who biffed left-armer seamer Topley for three sixes in a row in the 19th over and two more maximums in the final over off Mohammed Siraj, gave them those during his final assault.Also read: Updated Orange Cap Holder in IPL|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983870,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132002,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Mayank Yadav breaks his own record for fastest ball of IPL 2024|NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' pacer Mayank Yadav picked up right where he left off, making an immediate impact in the IPL 2024 match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday.The new pace sensation Mayank bettered his own record of 155.8 KMPH for the fastest ball of this season, unleashing a 156.7 KMPH delivery against RCB.The right-arm pacer, who stole the limelight with his match-winning spell of 3/27 on his IPL debut against Punjab Kings, struck in his first over to dismiss Glenn Maxwell.Mayank then produced an absolute ripper to castle Cameron Green as he got beaten for pace on the outside edge, resulting in the ball crashing into the off stump before racing away to the boundary.There was no stopping Mayank as he went on to pile misery on RCB with his third of the match in the form of Rajat Patidar. He returned astonishing figures of 3/14 in 4 overs.Australia's former fast-bowling star Brett Lee described Mayank as the "talk of the town.""First things first, I don't want to put any extra pressure on him, he is just 21. But he has got great pace and a nice action. I am super impressed with him, and really excited to see how he progresses in the next few months," Lee, a JioCinema IPL expert, said during a roundtable on Tuesday.Mayank had played just two List A games before he was picked by LSG ahead of IPL 2022. He did not play a single match in the first season and was ruled out of the next season with a torn hamstring.After he recovered from the injury, he played for North Zone in the 50-over Deodhar Trophy where he knocked out Rahul Tripathi's middle stump with a ripper.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock's innings provided the much-needed stability to the LSG's batting lineup, allowing them to construct a competitive total of 181 for five.Nicholas Pooran also played a crucial role, remaining unbeaten on 40 from just 21 balls, providing valuable support to De Kock's innings.In response, RCB briefly threatened to chase down the target of 182, primarily through the explosive batting of Mahipal Lomror , who blazed his way to a forceful 33 off just 13 deliveries. However, Lucknow's pace sensation, Mayank Yadav, had other plans.Mayank's scorching three-wicket haul, conceding a mere 14 runs, proved to be the turning point of the match. His fiery spell dismantled the RCB batting order, leaving them struggling at 153 all out.Skipper Faf du Plessis spoke his heart out while talking about young pace sensation Mayank, who single-handedly derailed RCB's run chase."Spot on (dropped catches cost us). Two very good players - QDK was on 25-30 and Pooran was on 2 - 60-65 extra runs, mistakes like that can cost you in the IPL. It is the new action you haven't faced before, and if they have pace then you need time to get used to it (about Mayank). But his ability to control length and have accuracy is impressive," Du Plessis said at the post-match presentation."I didn't think we were very good with our bowling especially in the powerplay, Maxwell brought it back and there were some pleasing signs in the death overs. You need two guys to bat through and get a partnership which we were not able to do. We need the strong characters in the dressing room to put their hands up," Du Plessis added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

They spend the money," Shastri said on Star Sports.Hardik was booed in the team's opening two matches and the crowd hostility was at its peak in MI's first home game of the season on Monday.Adding to the troubles, under his leadership, Mumbai's campaign in the 2024 IPL began with a disastrous start, leaving them at the bottom of the table after suffering three consecutive losses.Former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu believes that Rohit would not have been replaced by Hardik had the BCCI named him skipper for the T20 World Cup last year itself.Rohit was declared captain of India's yet-to-be-named T20 World Cup squad in February this year by BCCI secretary Jay Shah at an event in Ahmedabad, a good two months after he was replaced by Pandya as MI skipper."If the BCCI had named Rohit as captain for the T20 World Cup in October, the franchise wouldn't have chosen Hardik as captain. It's a matter of the franchise's respect.

This was third defeat on the trot for the five-time champions. The frustration also mounted for Mumbai Indians ' skipper Hardik Pandya as he bore the brunt of fans' ire on Monday.Yuzvendra Chahal (3/11) and Trent Boult (3/22) orchestrated a superb bowling performance, restricting Mumbai Indians to a modest 125/9.In reply, Riyan Parag (54 not out) then showcased his batting prowess yet again, guiding Rajasthan Royals to the top of the IPL points table.After the match, Rajasthan Royals' spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took to social media, shared a photo with Rohit Sharma and added a humorous caption to the post. Rohit, who scored 43 and 26 in the first two matches, was dismissed for a duck by Trent Boult against Rajasthan Royals."Garden mein Ghoomne wale bande ka 'Gardner' Rohit Sharma ke saath," Ashwin's post read.The “garden mein ghoomne wale bande” here refers to Rohit’s comments which the Indian skipper made during the five-match Test series against England.

But he has got great pace and a nice action. I am super impressed with him, and really excited to see how he progresses in the next few months," Lee, a JioCinema IPL expert, said during a roundtable on Tuesday."Mayank Yadav is the talk of the town. He has crossed 155, and hopefully, he is able to bowl even quicker tonight. I am looking forward to seeing how he backs up," Lee said before the Lucknow Super Giants' game against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.Mayank's lightning-fast deliveries, consistently exceeding 150 kmph, left spectators and cricket enthusiasts awestruck during Lucknow Super Giants' impressive 21-run victory over the Punjab Kings last Saturday.His sheer pace proved to be a formidable challenge for batsmen like Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, and Jitesh Sharma, ultimately contributing to Punjab Kings' downfall. Mayank's exceptional performance earned him the well-deserved accolade of Player of the Match.Switching gears to the topic of Virat Kohli , Brett Lee emphasised the importance of having key players like the Indian batting maestro in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Lee stressed that the presence of such experienced and influential figures is crucial for the success of their respective teams in the tournament, which is scheduled to take place across the United States and the West Indies in June."I would love to see big players playing in the T20 World Cup. I would love to see guys like Virat Kohli playing in the World Cup," he said.While Mayank has caught his attention with his pace and action, Lee feels Jasprit Bumrah remains the world's best fast bowler but added he has not been used effectively enough."The bowler who impressed me the most (this IPL) from a fast-bowling point of view, I am still impressed with Jasprit Bumrah. I don't think he has been used in the correct fashion. Though he was not at his best the other evening (on Monday against Rajasthan Royals)."It was hard for him to control the swing because he has not bowled with the brand-new ball in the last couple of matches. I would always like to see Bumrah using the brand-new ball," Lee said.Lee also expressed his approval of the two-bouncer rule implemented in the IPL, noting that it has played a significant role in restoring a degree of equilibrium between bat and ball in a format that heavily favours batsmen."Two-bouncer rule is good. There are a lot of things that go against the bowlers. The two-bouncer rule allows the fast bowlers to plan the batter's dismissal. Now they have got the option to bowl a short ball in the first ball and also the last ball.When pressed to identify his top four teams for the current IPL season, Lee expressed his confidence in the Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Chennai Super Kings, and Sunrisers Hyderabad."I made a prediction at the start two weeks ago. I see Delhi Capitals finishing on top this season, I have got RCB, the girls have done it and it's time for the guys to step up, then there is CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad."Asked about the 'Impact Player' rule, Lee said it "adds a lot of colour and value to the IPL"."It comes down to how the teams use it, you can also argue if you win the toss you can pick the best combination. I think they might go back to the drawing board later, but at the moment, it's working nicely," Lee said.Speaking about Mumbai Indians' poor start to the tournament, Lee warned against writing them off keeping in mind their penchant to fight back after slow starts."They are the most successful team in IPL's history. I am not concerned about Mumbai Indians at the moment. They are showing signs of how good they are as a team. I think patience is the key."MI have lost their first three matches.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27390,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Hussey replied when asked about what he made of the debate around Kohli's strike rate."He's a pretty good player. I don't think he's going to have too many issues. If you see the strike rate in this IPL, he seems to have taken his game to a new level, he's evolved again," Hussey told the media on the sidelines of the announcement of the launch of Melbourne Cricket Academy, a partnership between Cricket Victoria and KheloMore."You never write off champions, like you never write off Steve Smith, (like) you never write off Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma...""You never write them off and I'm certain that Virat Kohli is going to come out in the next World Cup and be the dominant force that he has been for the better part of a decade. Never write off your champions," Hussey reiterated.Hussey, who competed in the IPL representing Chennai Super Kings , Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), and Kolkata Knight Riders, noted that the competition has transformed, transitioning from a conservative style to an ultra-aggressive approach among teams."It's hit-hit, bang-bang from ball one now, whereas back in 2008, (it) was (about) take your time, get yourself in, try and have wickets in hand at the first 10-over mark and then try and get 180 or 190, (and) that was out of this world," he said."Now teams are getting 270 runs and other teams are almost chasing them down. If you face a couple of dot balls early and your strike rate is under 100, you're sort of ostracised, you don't fit to the T20 mould, so the planning that's evolved from 2008 till now is phenomenal - every ball, every over is really important," he said.Hussey, who was present at the Cricket Club of India along with Cricket Victoria CEO Nick Cummins and KheloMore CEO and selector Jatin Paranjape, said 10 years from now IPL would be entirely different."The game has evolved out of sight and like Nick (Cummins) said, I can't wait to see what the IPL and what T20 cricket looks like in a decade's time, because teams might get 300 runs and chase it down, which should be not good for fast bowlers or spinners but it's great for the game of cricket," he said.Hussey felt Australia will have a selection headache going into the World Cup, adding that players who are likely to feature in the T20 World Cup are getting an excellent opportunity to prepare for it in the IPL."There's competition for places, isn't there, in the Australian team? There's Travis Head who also opens up batting as well, who's playing particularly well," Hussey said."Anybody can beat anybody on their day, the pitch is a different, foreign conditions, but the players are very, very fortunate to have the IPL to play in and prepare very well in order to go to the World Cup and execute their skills," Hussey said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108978170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89452,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In the crucial 50th over, with England requiring nine runs from three balls, Erasmus and his fellow umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded England six runs for an overthrow. Subsequently, it was revealed that only five runs should have been granted to England, as the batsmen had not completed the second run before the overthrow occurred.This admission sheds light on a critical moment in the match, indicating that the outcome might have been different had the correct decision been made.“The next morning (after the final) I opened my hotel room door on my way to breakfast and Kumar opened his door at the same time and he said, ‘did you see we made a massive error?' That's when I got to know about it," Erasmus told 'The Telegraph'."But in the moment on the field, we just said six, you know, communicated to each other, ‘six, six, it's six' not realising that they haven't crossed, it wasn't picked up. That's it.”Marais Erasmus, who officiated as an on-field umpire in 127 Tests, 192 ODIs, and 61 T20s throughout his distinguished career, has confessed to yet another error during the 2019 ODI World Cup final, adding to the scrutiny surrounding the match.In the final played five years ago, Erasmus made a critical decision by adjudging Ross Taylor lbw off the bowling of Mark Wood . However, upon reflection, Erasmus acknowledged that this decision was also a mistake, further fueling the debate over the officiating in that high-stakes encounter.“It was just too high but they had burnt their review. That was my only error in the whole seven weeks and afterwards I was so disappointed because it would have been an absolute flip had I got through the whole World Cup not making an error and that obviously impacted the game a bit because he was one of their top players,” added the South African.Over the course of his long umpiring career, Erasmus was least pressurised by New Zealand, the perennial good guys of the game while the likes of Ricky Ponting and Mahela Jayawardene tried to intimidate him and his colleagues.“They (New Zealand) were always very, very respectful", while Ponting and Jayawardene "tried to intimidate us. Sometimes it was subtle and sometimes not subtle.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31046,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/dont-think-mi-have-used-jasprit-bumrah-in-the-correct-fashion-brett-lee/articleshow/108980839.cms|Don't think MI have used Jasprit Bumrah in the correct fashion: Brett Lee|MUMBAI: One of the major reasons the Mumbai Indians have slid to the bottom the IPL 2024 table after suffering three successive defeats right at the start is that in the first two matches, skipper Hardik Pandya , for some reason, held back pace ace Jasprit Bumrah from bowling in the Powerplay overs.It meant that MI missed out on his early strikes, even though Bumrah found a way to sizzle, taking 3-14 in four overs against Gujarat Titans and then 0-29 when the carnage was on against the Sunrisers.It's a tactic which hasn't gone down well with former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee , who feels that the 30-year-old India pacer's rhythm has been disturbed as a result of this move. "I'm still impressed with Bumrah, even though the other evening he didn't bowl the best that he's bowled. He's still world-class. There's one thing I'll say about Bumrah: I don't think they've (MI) have used him in the correct fashion. He has bowled the fourth and fifth over in a couple of games, and in the last one, he took the new ball. Even though it was the second over, it was hard for him to control the swing because he hadn't bowled with the brand new ball for a number of games. So, I'd love Bumrah to take the brand new ball first over," Lee, who is an IPL Expert on JioCinema, told reporters in a virtual presser on Tuesday.Lee, though, backed MI to bounce back from a pathetic start to their season, considering their past record. "If you have a look at their record, they're the most successful team in IPL history. I think back to when they won a tournament, they lost four games on the trot. So, I'm not concerned about MI at the moment. They do have a couple of issues with not scoring runs, bowlers not bowling their best in different areas, but they're still showing signs of how good they are as a team. I think that patience is the key with Mumbai at the moment," Lee asserted.Soon after India's new pace sensation Mayank Yadav clocked as fast as 155.8 kph while taking three for 27 for the Lucknow Super Giants against Punjab Kings a few days back, Lee had praised the 21-year-old on social media. It's clear that Lee, who used to terrorize batsmen with his sheer pace in a glittering career which saw him take 718 wickets in 322 international games, has been left mighty impressed by the Delhi fast bowler.However, the 47-year-old didn't want to talk about whether India should rush him into playing in the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA in June, lest it put "extra pressure" on him. "First things first, I don't want to put any extra pressure on him because if you're talking about the chance to represent India, it could put pressure on a guy who's just 21 years of age. But I'm super impressed with what I've seen so far. He's got great pace, a nice action, and got three wickets the other night. So, I'm really excited to see how he progresses over the next 12-18 months," Lee complimented."He's the talk of the town at the moment. He clocked 155 kph the other evening. I'm looking forward to watching him tonight. What I'm most looking forward to is to see how he backs up again tonight. Hopefully, his pace is even quicker tonight," Lee gushed.Lee is sticking to his prediction of RCB winning the title this year. "I've the Delhi Capitals, RCB, CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad finishing in my top 4. I've got RCB to win it this year. I thought the (RCB) girls played extremely well (to clinch the WPL title this year). It's time for the guys to step up," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980832,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58832,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It's a matter of the franchise's respect. So, the actual issue here is timing."Reflecting on the IPL matches, Sidhu acknowledged the hostility faced by Pandya from fans and attributed it to Rohit's immense popularity among cricket enthusiasts.He stated, "Nobody can digest the fact that India's hero, India's captain, is not the captain of our franchise. 'What wrong has he done?' is what fans of the franchise would be thinking. But what does he have to do? There is nothing that succeeds like success. If he had won these two matches, there wouldn't have been any noise."Furthermore, Sidhu emphasized the significance of IPL performances in shaping the T20 World Cup squads of all participating teams. He added, "The entire world revolves around the IPL. Playing in the IPL just before the World Cup is like participating in a mini World Cup.

Following the defeat to Rajasthan Royals , the former IPL-winning captain with Gujarat Titans shared a few words of motivation on X, asserting, "If there's one thing you should know about this team, we never give up. We'll keep fighting, we'll keep going."Facing criticism from fans following his appointment as captain in place of Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya has encountered hostility from the crowds in recent matches.Despite the adversity, he remains steadfast in his commitment to lead the team through difficult times.MI's campaign in the 2024 IPL has suffered a setback with three consecutive losses, placing them at the bottom of the table. However, history suggests that the franchise has often started slowly in previous seasons, only to bounce back strongly, as seen in their title-winning campaign in 2015.Questions have arisen regarding Hardik's captaincy decisions, including the handling of key players like Jasprit Bumrah and the batting order, exemplified by sending Tim David ahead of himself in a recent match against Gujarat Titans.The change in leadership has led to divided sentiments among Mumbai Indians supporters, evident from chants of "Rohit Rohit" echoing at the Wankhede Stadium during the team's home game.Despite the dissent, Rohit Sharma himself urged the crowd to refrain from booing Hardik, emphasizing unity and support for the team.Looking ahead, Mumbai Indians will aim to turn their fortunes around as they prepare to take on Delhi Capitals in their next fixture at home on Sunday.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108970233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-87994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This triumph came after a 28-year wait since their first victory in 1983.Entering the 2011 tournament, India stood as clear favorites, especially with the competition held in the sub-continent. Led by the astute MS Dhoni , India showcased dominance, losing just one match in the tournament against South Africa.The semi-final clash against arch-rivals Pakistan set the stage for a thrilling final showdown with Sri Lanka. Winning the toss, Sri Lanka opted to bat first, with Mahela Jayawardene 's century driving them to a competitive 274/6.India's pursuit got off to a shaky start with early losses, but Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni's resilience forged a crucial 109-run partnership. Although Gambhir fell short of a century, Dhoni, alongside Yuvraj Singh , steered India to victory with six wickets in hand, Dhoni's iconic winning six etching itself into Indian sporting lore.The moment was made even more poignant as Sachin Tendulkar , witnessing his dream realized after years of dedication, erupted with joy, tears of fulfilment streaming down his face.Tendulkar's euphoric lap around the Wankhede Stadium post-victory, titled 'Carried On the Shoulders Of A Nation,' was later voted the greatest Laureus Sporting Moment of the past two decades, symbolizing the collective joy of a nation.The former Indian stars, who played a major role in India's triumph in the 2011 ODI World Cup, took to social media in a bid to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the success.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108960966,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-133342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

His crucial partnership of 83 runs for the third-wicket with Gautam Gambhir laid the foundation for India's successful pursuit of the 275-run target set by Sri Lanka.In a heartfelt video shared by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on their official social media handle, Kohli expressed the profound significance of winning the World Cup in front of the home crowd.Watch:Recalling the electric atmosphere at the Wankhede Stadium, Kohli recounted, "The fact that we played in Wankhede and we ended up winning is always gonna be special thing winning in front of your home fans is an experience I will never ever forget and that night, the songs that were been played, like Vande Mataram. Goosebumps that we all felt is always gonna be a core memory for me.".In a recap of the final showdown against Sri Lanka, Gautam Gambhir's stellar innings of 97 runs and MS Dhoni 's unbeaten 91* emerged as the cornerstone of India's victory, steering the 'Men in Blue' towards their triumphant chase of the 275-run target set by Kumar Sangakkara's side.Dhoni's exemplary performance earned him the coveted title of 'Player of the Match' as he delivered the clinching moment with a powerful stroke that sailed over the boundary for a massive six.

Where Pant scores over others is his ability to take down spin and his left-handedness. His fitness in a high intensity format after a lengthy injury layoff remains the only question.While his T20 numbers aren't great, there is little doubt about whether Rohit and Dravid will want him in the squad or not if he is fit.India may need to travel with two wicket-keeper batters in the squad of 15 and carry another one as a travelling reserve because of the difficulty in getting players across quickly if there is an unfortunate injury or illness to any of the team members.Hence Jitesh Sharma, Sanju Samson, KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan will all have their hopes high of getting on the plane to the US.The thing going for Jitesh is he is performing the same role for his franchise, the Punjab Kings, that India have earmarked for him, that of a finisher, who can attack in the end overs at No.6.With Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan and KL Rahul effectively being top-order players, who target the powerplay overs, it might make it tough for them to break into the top four of the Indian team as it has gun players likeRohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav batting in those slots.Will Kishan, Sanju and Rahul take the option of batting lower in the batting order and hurt their franchise's chances in the IPL and audition for a slot in the Indian team? If they do, the franchise owners will sport a long face.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108962569,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64086,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock departed soon, lofting Reece Topley to Dagar at long-on.The LSG were 143 for four in 16.3 overs at that stage and needed a few more runs to reach safer shores.Pooran, who biffed left-armer seamer Topley for three sixes in a row in the 19th over and two more maximums in the final over off Mohammed Siraj, gave them those during his final assault.Also read: Updated Orange Cap Holder in IPL|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983870,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132002,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Mayank Yadav breaks his own record for fastest ball of IPL 2024|NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' pacer Mayank Yadav picked up right where he left off, making an immediate impact in the IPL 2024 match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday.The new pace sensation Mayank bettered his own record of 155.8 KMPH for the fastest ball of this season, unleashing a 156.7 KMPH delivery against RCB.The right-arm pacer, who stole the limelight with his match-winning spell of 3/27 on his IPL debut against Punjab Kings, struck in his first over to dismiss Glenn Maxwell.Mayank then produced an absolute ripper to castle Cameron Green as he got beaten for pace on the outside edge, resulting in the ball crashing into the off stump before racing away to the boundary.There was no stopping Mayank as he went on to pile misery on RCB with his third of the match in the form of Rajat Patidar. He returned astonishing figures of 3/14 in 4 overs.Australia's former fast-bowling star Brett Lee described Mayank as the "talk of the town.""First things first, I don't want to put any extra pressure on him, he is just 21. But he has got great pace and a nice action. I am super impressed with him, and really excited to see how he progresses in the next few months," Lee, a JioCinema IPL expert, said during a roundtable on Tuesday.Mayank had played just two List A games before he was picked by LSG ahead of IPL 2022. He did not play a single match in the first season and was ruled out of the next season with a torn hamstring.After he recovered from the injury, he played for North Zone in the 50-over Deodhar Trophy where he knocked out Rahul Tripathi's middle stump with a ripper.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

De Kock's innings provided the much-needed stability to the LSG's batting lineup, allowing them to construct a competitive total of 181 for five.Nicholas Pooran also played a crucial role, remaining unbeaten on 40 from just 21 balls, providing valuable support to De Kock's innings.In response, RCB briefly threatened to chase down the target of 182, primarily through the explosive batting of Mahipal Lomror , who blazed his way to a forceful 33 off just 13 deliveries. However, Lucknow's pace sensation, Mayank Yadav, had other plans.Mayank's scorching three-wicket haul, conceding a mere 14 runs, proved to be the turning point of the match. His fiery spell dismantled the RCB batting order, leaving them struggling at 153 all out.Skipper Faf du Plessis spoke his heart out while talking about young pace sensation Mayank, who single-handedly derailed RCB's run chase."Spot on (dropped catches cost us). Two very good players - QDK was on 25-30 and Pooran was on 2 - 60-65 extra runs, mistakes like that can cost you in the IPL. It is the new action you haven't faced before, and if they have pace then you need time to get used to it (about Mayank). But his ability to control length and have accuracy is impressive," Du Plessis said at the post-match presentation."I didn't think we were very good with our bowling especially in the powerplay, Maxwell brought it back and there were some pleasing signs in the death overs. You need two guys to bat through and get a partnership which we were not able to do. We need the strong characters in the dressing room to put their hands up," Du Plessis added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108983897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

My aim is to play for India as much as possible. So I feel this is just the start and my main goal is what I am focussed on.I think to bowl at this speed, a lot of things are important. Diet, sleep, training. If you bowl fast, you have to be perfect in a lot of things. So right now I focus a lot on my diet and recovery," he said.Talking about the match, Lucknow rode onQuinton De Kock 's 56-ball 81 and an unbeaten 40 by Nicholas Pooran to post 181-5 at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.RCB were bowled out for 153 and suffered their third loss in four matches this season.

They spend the money," Shastri said on Star Sports.Hardik was booed in the team's opening two matches and the crowd hostility was at its peak in MI's first home game of the season on Monday.Adding to the troubles, under his leadership, Mumbai's campaign in the 2024 IPL began with a disastrous start, leaving them at the bottom of the table after suffering three consecutive losses.Former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu believes that Rohit would not have been replaced by Hardik had the BCCI named him skipper for the T20 World Cup last year itself.Rohit was declared captain of India's yet-to-be-named T20 World Cup squad in February this year by BCCI secretary Jay Shah at an event in Ahmedabad, a good two months after he was replaced by Pandya as MI skipper."If the BCCI had named Rohit as captain for the T20 World Cup in October, the franchise wouldn't have chosen Hardik as captain. It's a matter of the franchise's respect.

This was third defeat on the trot for the five-time champions. The frustration also mounted for Mumbai Indians ' skipper Hardik Pandya as he bore the brunt of fans' ire on Monday.Yuzvendra Chahal (3/11) and Trent Boult (3/22) orchestrated a superb bowling performance, restricting Mumbai Indians to a modest 125/9.In reply, Riyan Parag (54 not out) then showcased his batting prowess yet again, guiding Rajasthan Royals to the top of the IPL points table.After the match, Rajasthan Royals' spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took to social media, shared a photo with Rohit Sharma and added a humorous caption to the post. Rohit, who scored 43 and 26 in the first two matches, was dismissed for a duck by Trent Boult against Rajasthan Royals."Garden mein Ghoomne wale bande ka 'Gardner' Rohit Sharma ke saath," Ashwin's post read.The “garden mein ghoomne wale bande” here refers to Rohit’s comments which the Indian skipper made during the five-match Test series against England. He was heard saying in the stump mic: “Koi bhi garden mein ghumega, *.”Since then Rohit's garden comment became famous.After clinching the series 4-1 against England, Rohit had shared a photo on his social media account with Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Sarfaraz Khan, and Dhruv Jurel, acknowledging the contributions of the promising youngsters to the team's success."Garden mein ghoomne wale bande," Rohit wrote.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108979195,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-75142,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

But he has got great pace and a nice action. I am super impressed with him, and really excited to see how he progresses in the next few months," Lee, a JioCinema IPL expert, said during a roundtable on Tuesday."Mayank Yadav is the talk of the town. He has crossed 155, and hopefully, he is able to bowl even quicker tonight. I am looking forward to seeing how he backs up," Lee said before the Lucknow Super Giants' game against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.Mayank's lightning-fast deliveries, consistently exceeding 150 kmph, left spectators and cricket enthusiasts awestruck during Lucknow Super Giants' impressive 21-run victory over the Punjab Kings last Saturday.His sheer pace proved to be a formidable challenge for batsmen like Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, and Jitesh Sharma, ultimately contributing to Punjab Kings' downfall. Mayank's exceptional performance earned him the well-deserved accolade of Player of the Match.Switching gears to the topic of Virat Kohli , Brett Lee emphasised the importance of having key players like the Indian batting maestro in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Lee stressed that the presence of such experienced and influential figures is crucial for the success of their respective teams in the tournament, which is scheduled to take place across the United States and the West Indies in June."I would love to see big players playing in the T20 World Cup. I would love to see guys like Virat Kohli playing in the World Cup," he said.While Mayank has caught his attention with his pace and action, Lee feels Jasprit Bumrah remains the world's best fast bowler but added he has not been used effectively enough."The bowler who impressed me the most (this IPL) from a fast-bowling point of view, I am still impressed with Jasprit Bumrah. I don't think he has been used in the correct fashion. Though he was not at his best the other evening (on Monday against Rajasthan Royals)."It was hard for him to control the swing because he has not bowled with the brand-new ball in the last couple of matches. I would always like to see Bumrah using the brand-new ball," Lee said.Lee also expressed his approval of the two-bouncer rule implemented in the IPL, noting that it has played a significant role in restoring a degree of equilibrium between bat and ball in a format that heavily favours batsmen."Two-bouncer rule is good. There are a lot of things that go against the bowlers. The two-bouncer rule allows the fast bowlers to plan the batter's dismissal. Now they have got the option to bowl a short ball in the first ball and also the last ball.When pressed to identify his top four teams for the current IPL season, Lee expressed his confidence in the Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Chennai Super Kings, and Sunrisers Hyderabad."I made a prediction at the start two weeks ago. I see Delhi Capitals finishing on top this season, I have got RCB, the girls have done it and it's time for the guys to step up, then there is CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad."Asked about the 'Impact Player' rule, Lee said it "adds a lot of colour and value to the IPL"."It comes down to how the teams use it, you can also argue if you win the toss you can pick the best combination. I think they might go back to the drawing board later, but at the moment, it's working nicely," Lee said.Speaking about Mumbai Indians' poor start to the tournament, Lee warned against writing them off keeping in mind their penchant to fight back after slow starts."They are the most successful team in IPL's history. I am not concerned about Mumbai Indians at the moment. They are showing signs of how good they are as a team. I think patience is the key."MI have lost their first three matches.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27390,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Hussey replied when asked about what he made of the debate around Kohli's strike rate."He's a pretty good player. I don't think he's going to have too many issues. If you see the strike rate in this IPL, he seems to have taken his game to a new level, he's evolved again," Hussey told the media on the sidelines of the announcement of the launch of Melbourne Cricket Academy, a partnership between Cricket Victoria and KheloMore."You never write off champions, like you never write off Steve Smith, (like) you never write off Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma...""You never write them off and I'm certain that Virat Kohli is going to come out in the next World Cup and be the dominant force that he has been for the better part of a decade. Never write off your champions," Hussey reiterated.Hussey, who competed in the IPL representing Chennai Super Kings , Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), and Kolkata Knight Riders, noted that the competition has transformed, transitioning from a conservative style to an ultra-aggressive approach among teams."It's hit-hit, bang-bang from ball one now, whereas back in 2008, (it) was (about) take your time, get yourself in, try and have wickets in hand at the first 10-over mark and then try and get 180 or 190, (and) that was out of this world," he said."Now teams are getting 270 runs and other teams are almost chasing them down. If you face a couple of dot balls early and your strike rate is under 100, you're sort of ostracised, you don't fit to the T20 mould, so the planning that's evolved from 2008 till now is phenomenal - every ball, every over is really important," he said.Hussey, who was present at the Cricket Club of India along with Cricket Victoria CEO Nick Cummins and KheloMore CEO and selector Jatin Paranjape, said 10 years from now IPL would be entirely different."The game has evolved out of sight and like Nick (Cummins) said, I can't wait to see what the IPL and what T20 cricket looks like in a decade's time, because teams might get 300 runs and chase it down, which should be not good for fast bowlers or spinners but it's great for the game of cricket," he said.Hussey felt Australia will have a selection headache going into the World Cup, adding that players who are likely to feature in the T20 World Cup are getting an excellent opportunity to prepare for it in the IPL."There's competition for places, isn't there, in the Australian team? There's Travis Head who also opens up batting as well, who's playing particularly well," Hussey said."Anybody can beat anybody on their day, the pitch is a different, foreign conditions, but the players are very, very fortunate to have the IPL to play in and prepare very well in order to go to the World Cup and execute their skills," Hussey said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108978170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89452,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The all-rounder was booed in the team's opening two matches and the crowd hostility was at its peak in MI's first home game of the season at Wankhede on Monday.Questions were raised regarding Hardik's leadership decisions, including his choice not to start with Jasprit Bumrah bowling with the new ball and sending Tim David to bat ahead of himself against the Gujarat Titans.Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan also launched a scathing attack on Pandya's leadership saying a leader can only earn team's respect when he does difficult things."You always want your Leader to do the difficult things. If he doesn't do it he won't earn his team's respect," Pathan posted on X.However, Pandya on Tuesday asserted that the former champions will not give up and will continue to fight in the ongoing IPL despite slumping to a hat-trick of defeats."If there's one thing you should know about this team, we never give up. We'll keep fighting, we'll keep going," Hardik wrote on X.MI are known to be perennial slow starters.

In the crucial 50th over, with England requiring nine runs from three balls, Erasmus and his fellow umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded England six runs for an overthrow. Subsequently, it was revealed that only five runs should have been granted to England, as the batsmen had not completed the second run before the overthrow occurred.This admission sheds light on a critical moment in the match, indicating that the outcome might have been different had the correct decision been made.“The next morning (after the final) I opened my hotel room door on my way to breakfast and Kumar opened his door at the same time and he said, ‘did you see we made a massive error?' That's when I got to know about it," Erasmus told 'The Telegraph'."But in the moment on the field, we just said six, you know, communicated to each other, ‘six, six, it's six' not realising that they haven't crossed, it wasn't picked up. That's it.”Marais Erasmus, who officiated as an on-field umpire in 127 Tests, 192 ODIs, and 61 T20s throughout his distinguished career, has confessed to yet another error during the 2019 ODI World Cup final, adding to the scrutiny surrounding the match.In the final played five years ago, Erasmus made a critical decision by adjudging Ross Taylor lbw off the bowling of Mark Wood . However, upon reflection, Erasmus acknowledged that this decision was also a mistake, further fueling the debate over the officiating in that high-stakes encounter.“It was just too high but they had burnt their review. That was my only error in the whole seven weeks and afterwards I was so disappointed because it would have been an absolute flip had I got through the whole World Cup not making an error and that obviously impacted the game a bit because he was one of their top players,” added the South African.Over the course of his long umpiring career, Erasmus was least pressurised by New Zealand, the perennial good guys of the game while the likes of Ricky Ponting and Mahela Jayawardene tried to intimidate him and his colleagues.“They (New Zealand) were always very, very respectful", while Ponting and Jayawardene "tried to intimidate us. Sometimes it was subtle and sometimes not subtle.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31046,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/dont-think-mi-have-used-jasprit-bumrah-in-the-correct-fashion-brett-lee/articleshow/108980839.cms|Don't think MI have used Jasprit Bumrah in the correct fashion: Brett Lee|MUMBAI: One of the major reasons the Mumbai Indians have slid to the bottom the IPL 2024 table after suffering three successive defeats right at the start is that in the first two matches, skipper Hardik Pandya , for some reason, held back pace ace Jasprit Bumrah from bowling in the Powerplay overs.It meant that MI missed out on his early strikes, even though Bumrah found a way to sizzle, taking 3-14 in four overs against Gujarat Titans and then 0-29 when the carnage was on against the Sunrisers.It's a tactic which hasn't gone down well with former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee , who feels that the 30-year-old India pacer's rhythm has been disturbed as a result of this move. "I'm still impressed with Bumrah, even though the other evening he didn't bowl the best that he's bowled. He's still world-class. There's one thing I'll say about Bumrah: I don't think they've (MI) have used him in the correct fashion. He has bowled the fourth and fifth over in a couple of games, and in the last one, he took the new ball. Even though it was the second over, it was hard for him to control the swing because he hadn't bowled with the brand new ball for a number of games. So, I'd love Bumrah to take the brand new ball first over," Lee, who is an IPL Expert on JioCinema, told reporters in a virtual presser on Tuesday.Lee, though, backed MI to bounce back from a pathetic start to their season, considering their past record. "If you have a look at their record, they're the most successful team in IPL history. I think back to when they won a tournament, they lost four games on the trot. So, I'm not concerned about MI at the moment. They do have a couple of issues with not scoring runs, bowlers not bowling their best in different areas, but they're still showing signs of how good they are as a team. I think that patience is the key with Mumbai at the moment," Lee asserted.Soon after India's new pace sensation Mayank Yadav clocked as fast as 155.8 kph while taking three for 27 for the Lucknow Super Giants against Punjab Kings a few days back, Lee had praised the 21-year-old on social media. It's clear that Lee, who used to terrorize batsmen with his sheer pace in a glittering career which saw him take 718 wickets in 322 international games, has been left mighty impressed by the Delhi fast bowler.However, the 47-year-old didn't want to talk about whether India should rush him into playing in the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA in June, lest it put "extra pressure" on him. "First things first, I don't want to put any extra pressure on him because if you're talking about the chance to represent India, it could put pressure on a guy who's just 21 years of age. But I'm super impressed with what I've seen so far. He's got great pace, a nice action, and got three wickets the other night. So, I'm really excited to see how he progresses over the next 12-18 months," Lee complimented."He's the talk of the town at the moment. He clocked 155 kph the other evening. I'm looking forward to watching him tonight. What I'm most looking forward to is to see how he backs up again tonight. Hopefully, his pace is even quicker tonight," Lee gushed.Lee is sticking to his prediction of RCB winning the title this year. "I've the Delhi Capitals, RCB, CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad finishing in my top 4. I've got RCB to win it this year. I thought the (RCB) girls played extremely well (to clinch the WPL title this year). It's time for the guys to step up," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980832,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58832,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

'What wrong has he done?' is what fans of the franchise would be thinking. But what does he have to do? There is nothing that succeeds like success. If he had won these two matches, there wouldn't have been any noise."Furthermore, Sidhu emphasized the significance of IPL performances in shaping the T20 World Cup squads of all participating teams.

The protégé, coming back to competitive cricket after a horrific accident in December 2022, showed his wares first, then the master turned it on and made everyone stand up and yearn for more.Dhoni's powerful hits to the boundary ropes, and beyond it, were reminiscent of the time he went berserk against bowlers soon after he had made his international debut.His flowing golden mane peering out of the helmet added to the trip down the memory lane. His fans had spent two matches in this year's IPL without getting to see him wield the willow. They were eagerly waiting for those timeless MSD sixes.Dhoni hit three of them on Sunday, one with a single hand that landed in the second tier beyond the mid-wicket fence. There were four bludgeoned boundaries too. Sixteen balls, twenty-two minutes at the crease, yielded 37 runs and made the fans present at the stadium and those watching on TV delirious.Dhoni's 'box-office' effect makes spectators, pundits, former cricketers question why he doesn't come early and bats so low down the order. On Sunday, he batted at No. 8.Ex-Australia captain Michael Clarke thinks Dhoni is prepping for bigger challenges ahead."Every MS Dhoni fan wants to see him as high up the order as possible. We've all said he should open the batting. I think if there's a game on the line and he needs to go up the order because it's what's best for the team, I'm sure he will," Clarke said.Maybe Dhoni will bat higher up when the situation arises, but Pant did bat two rungs above his normal batting position on Sunday. Coming at No. 3, Pant put to rest concerns regarding his ability to bat like the days of yore.A slog-swept six over mid-wicket got him going on the night. But what grabbed eyeballs was how he handled the sling-shot Matheesha Pathirana who hit the timber twice with two thunderbolt yorkers.Pathirana tried his slinging, high-on-pace yorkers to Pant, but those were dispatched over the long-on boundary and sliced towards the cover point fence. .Pant looks fit as a fiddle post his "inspirational" comeback which has the cricketing world all gushing."To think that Rishabh did this after the injuries that he sustained is unbelievable," former Australian allrounder Shane Watson said."You're not a true human being if you're not inspired by Rishabh Pant, the way he was able to come out and turn it on like that. It took him a little while to find his feet but once he let those shackles off, he played some 'Rishabh Pant' shots, and they were extraordinary."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108960773,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78638,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Following the defeat to Rajasthan Royals , the former IPL-winning captain with Gujarat Titans shared a few words of motivation on X, asserting, "If there's one thing you should know about this team, we never give up. We'll keep fighting, we'll keep going."Facing criticism from fans following his appointment as captain in place of Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya has encountered hostility from the crowds in recent matches.Despite the adversity, he remains steadfast in his commitment to lead the team through difficult times.MI's campaign in the 2024 IPL has suffered a setback with three consecutive losses, placing them at the bottom of the table. However, history suggests that the franchise has often started slowly in previous seasons, only to bounce back strongly, as seen in their title-winning campaign in 2015.Questions have arisen regarding Hardik's captaincy decisions, including the handling of key players like Jasprit Bumrah and the batting order, exemplified by sending Tim David ahead of himself in a recent match against Gujarat Titans.The change in leadership has led to divided sentiments among Mumbai Indians supporters, evident from chants of "Rohit Rohit" echoing at the Wankhede Stadium during the team's home game.Despite the dissent, Rohit Sharma himself urged the crowd to refrain from booing Hardik, emphasizing unity and support for the team.Looking ahead, Mumbai Indians will aim to turn their fortunes around as they prepare to take on Delhi Capitals in their next fixture at home on Sunday.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108970233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-87994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

His crucial partnership of 83 runs for the third-wicket with Gautam Gambhir laid the foundation for India's successful pursuit of the 275-run target set by Sri Lanka.In a heartfelt video shared by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on their official social media handle, Kohli expressed the profound significance of winning the World Cup in front of the home crowd.Watch:Recalling the electric atmosphere at the Wankhede Stadium, Kohli recounted, "The fact that we played in Wankhede and we ended up winning is always gonna be special thing winning in front of your home fans is an experience I will never ever forget and that night, the songs that were been played, like Vande Mataram. Goosebumps that we all felt is always gonna be a core memory for me.".In a recap of the final showdown against Sri Lanka, Gautam Gambhir's stellar innings of 97 runs and MS Dhoni 's unbeaten 91* emerged as the cornerstone of India's victory, steering the 'Men in Blue' towards their triumphant chase of the 275-run target set by Kumar Sangakkara's side.Dhoni's exemplary performance earned him the coveted title of 'Player of the Match' as he delivered the clinching moment with a powerful stroke that sailed over the boundary for a massive six. This decisive blow propelled India to a commanding six-wicket victory, sealing India's second World Cup title in the 50-over format.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108965067,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61108,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Where Pant scores over others is his ability to take down spin and his left-handedness. His fitness in a high intensity format after a lengthy injury layoff remains the only question.While his T20 numbers aren't great, there is little doubt about whether Rohit and Dravid will want him in the squad or not if he is fit.India may need to travel with two wicket-keeper batters in the squad of 15 and carry another one as a travelling reserve because of the difficulty in getting players across quickly if there is an unfortunate injury or illness to any of the team members.Hence Jitesh Sharma, Sanju Samson, KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan will all have their hopes high of getting on the plane to the US.The thing going for Jitesh is he is performing the same role for his franchise, the Punjab Kings, that India have earmarked for him, that of a finisher, who can attack in the end overs at No.6.With Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan and KL Rahul effectively being top-order players, who target the powerplay overs, it might make it tough for them to break into the top four of the Indian team as it has gun players likeRohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav batting in those slots.Will Kishan, Sanju and Rahul take the option of batting lower in the batting order and hurt their franchise's chances in the IPL and audition for a slot in the Indian team? If they do, the franchise owners will sport a long face.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108962569,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64086,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/worlds-most-powerful-mri-scans-first-images-of-human-brain/articleshow/108979894.cms|World's most powerful MRI scans first images of human brain|- Lighting up the brain's regions - - On the trail of Alzheimer's - The world's most powerful MRI scanner has delivered its first images of human brains, reaching a new level of precision that is hoped will shed more light on our mysterious minds -- and the illnesses that haunt them.Researchers at France's Atomic Energy Commission ( CEA ) first used the machine to scan a pumpkin back in 2021. But health authorities recently gave them the green light to scan humans.Over the past few months, around 20 healthy volunteers have become the first to enter the maw of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, which is located in the Plateau de Saclay area south of Paris, home to many technology companies and universities."We have seen a level of precision never reached before at CEA," said Alexandre Vignaud, a physicist working on the project.The magnetic field created by the scanner is a whopping 11.7 teslas, a unit of measurement named after inventor Nikola Tesla.This power allows the machine to scan images with 10 times more precision than the MRIs commonly used in hospitals, whose power does not normally exceed three teslas.On a computer screen, Vignaud compared images taken by this mighty scanner, dubbed Iseult, with those from a normal MRI."With this machine, we can see the tiny vessels which feed the cerebral cortex, or details of the cerebellum which were almost invisible until now," he said.France's research minister Sylvie Retailleau, herself a physicist, said "the precision is hardly believable!""This world-first will allow better detection and treatment for pathologies of the brain," she said in a statement to AFP.Inside a cylinder that is fives metres (16 feet) long and tall, the machine houses a 132-tonne magnet powered by a coil carrying a current of 1,500 amps.There is a 90-centimetre (three-foot) opening for humans to slide into.The design is the result of two decades of research by a partnership between French and German engineers.The United States and South Korea are working on similarly powerful MRI machines, but have not yet started scanning images of humans.One of the main goals of such a powerful scanner is to refine our understanding of the anatomy of the brain and which areas are activated when it carries out particular tasks.Scientists have already used MRIs to show that when the brain recognises particular things -- such as faces, places or words -- distinct regions of the cerebral cortex kick into gear.Harnessing the power of 11.7 teslas will help Iseult to "better understand the relationship between the brain's structure and cognitive functions, for example when we read a book or carry out a mental calculation," said Nicolas Boulant, the project's scientific director.The researchers hope that the scanner's power could also shed light on the elusive mechanisms behind neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's -- or psychological conditions like depression or schizophrenia."For example, we know that a particular area of the brain -- the hippocampus -- is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, so we hope to be able to find out how the cells work in this part of the cerebral cortex," said CEA researcher Anne-Isabelle Etienvre.The scientists also hope to map out how certain drugs used to treat bipolar disorder, such as lithium, distribute through the brain.The strong magnetic field created by the MRI will give a clearer image of which parts of the brain are targeted by lithium. This could help identify which patients will respond better or worse to the drug."If we can better understand these very harmful diseases, we should be able to diagnose them earlier -- and therefore treat them better," Etienvre said.For the foreseeable future, regular patients will not be able to use Iseult's mighty power to see inside their own brains.Boulant said the machine "is not intended to become a clinical diagnostic tool, but we hope the knowledge learned can then be used in hospitals".In the coming months, a new crop of healthy patients will be recruited to get their brains scanned.The machine will not be used on patients with conditions for several years.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108979940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-scientists-unravel-genetic-secrets-behind-lumpy-skin-disease-outbreak/articleshow/108972721.cms|Indian scientists unravel genetic secrets behind lumpy skin disease outbreak|BENGALURU: In a breakthrough, a multi-institutional team of Indian scientists has unveiled critical insights into the evolution and origins of the Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) strains fueling the outbreak .“In May 2022, cattle across India began dying of a mysterious illness. Since then, about 1 lakh cattle heads have been lost to a devastating outbreak of what scientists have identified as LSDV.The outbreak has severely affected India's agricultural sector, leading to staggering economic losses,” IISc said Tuesday.IISc’s Prof Utpal Tatu, who is part of the multi-institutional team that probed the cause of the outbreak termed it a “calamity” in some ways, “a national emergency”.The team’s study, published in the journal BMC Genomics, provides a comprehensive genomic analysis of the LSDV variants circulating in India, shedding light on the virus’s enhanced virulence and the severity of the disease.“The biggest challenge was the lack of an established LSDV genome sequencing and analysis pipeline. We had to adapt techniques from Covid-19 research,” said Ankeet Kumar, a PhD student at IISc and co-lead author of the study.Researchers conducted advanced whole-genome sequencing of 22 samples collected from infected cattle in various states, including Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Their analysis revealed two distinct LSDV variants — one with a low number ofgenetic variations and another with a high number of variations.Alarmingly, the highly varied strain was found to be similar to LSDV strains from an outbreak in Russia in 2015, suggesting a possible introduction of a foreign strain into India. Moreover, the team identified over 1,800 genetic variations, including deletions, insertions, and single-letter changes in DNA, many of which were found in viral genes critical for host cell binding, immune evasion, and efficient replication.“Cattle developed more severe symptoms in areas where we found highly diverse strains. This suggests that the genetic variations could elevate virulence,” Kumar said, while Tatu said the genomic data will prove invaluable for vaccine development by revealing molecular hotspots and genetic variations to target.IISc said that the study represents an example of the One Health approach in which multidisciplinary teams, including molecular biologists, computational experts and veterinary doctors come together to address issues of national relevance.Tatu emphasised how collaboration between veterinary experts and multiple scientific institutions was critical to tracing the variants across the country. “We learned a lot from the veterinary doctors. They understand the field knowledge, and their perception about the disease was very important,” Tatu said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108972826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-794305,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

NEW DELHI: Indian astronomers are poised to play a pivotal role in the global effort of the 16-nation Square Kilometer Array Observatory ( SKAO ), an ambitious venture set to embark on scanning the cosmos in 2027. India, which joined the consortium in January, is among the key contributors to what is hailed as the largest telescope project of the 21st century, combining the forces of radio astronomy and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore cosmic phenomena including the lifecycle of stars, habitable planets, and the potential for extraterrestrial life, a report in Russia Today said.The SKAO, with a budget of €2.2 billion ($2.4 billion), includes member nations such as South Africa, Australia, the UK, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. India has allocated Rs 12.5 billion ($150 million) for the establishment of a regional data center in Pune, a city renowned for its radio astronomy research. This center will house supercomputers tasked with processing the vast scientific data collected by the telescope, the RT report said.Utilizing radio interferometry, the SKAO will integrate signals from numerous antennas across large distances to produce images of unprecedented clarity and brightness. This network of antennas, spanning continents, aims to document cosmic phenomena to fill the equivalent of 1.5 million laptops annually with data."The idea is to start training this year (using AI to decode scientific information) with approximately two petabytes of data archived through GMRT. We will use this to develop a small model demonstrating that India is ready to receive and analyze the data," said Prof Yashwant Gupta, director of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune.The SKAO's construction sites include South Africa's Karoo region and Western Australia, chosen for their remoteness to minimize signal interference. The first components of the telescope's dish array antennas were installed in early March, with full operational capability expected by 2027.The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) is an international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope, aiming to explore the universe in unprecedented detail. It involves the collaboration of multiple countries and is one of the most ambitious astronomy projects of the 21st century. The project seeks to provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions about the universe, including the nature of gravity, the search for life beyond Earth, and the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter.The SKAO is not a single telescope but rather a collection of thousands of antennas and dishes spread over long distances, creating a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometer, hence its name. It will have two major components: one located in South Africa, consisting of mid-frequency dish antennas, and the other in Western Australia, composed of low-frequency antennas.The array's design allows for an immense field of view and the capability to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than has ever been done. By combining signals from many antennas spread over vast distances, SKAO will effectively create a telescope with a diameter of thousands of kilometers, providing astronomers with sharp and sensitive images of the sky in radio wavelengths.Radio astronomy, the field SKAO will advance, observes the universe in radio frequencies, allowing scientists to study celestial phenomena that are not visible with optical telescopes, including the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, the cosmic web, and potentially the signatures of extraterrestrial life.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108970150,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30546,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Last year, the country witnessed 422 cases, the highest annual count since 2014. As of March 25 this year, 143 cases have been reported, which is a significant increase from the same time last year.The majority of these cases are attributed to the serogroup Y ST-1466 strain, predominantly affecting adults aged 30 to 60, and notably impacting Black or African American people and individuals with HIV.Alarmingly, this strain has demonstrated a higher fatality rate compared to those in previous years, with an 18% fatality rate among 94 patients, versus the 11% rate recorded between 2017 and 2021.The CDC describes meningococcal disease as a severe illness that can lead to symptoms of meningitis, such as fever, stiff neck, headache, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. It can also trigger a bloodstream infection characterized by fever, chills, fatigue, and rapid breathing, among other symptoms. The disease spreads through close contact, such as coughing or kissing, or prolonged presence in the same room as an infected individual.Dr Barbara Bawer, a primary care physician, emphasized the rapid progression of the disease, which can become fatal within hours without prompt antibiotic treatment. Despite treatment, the disease can still be lethal, often due to misdiagnosis.Prevention measures include vaccination with the MenACWY and MenB vaccines, recommended for adolescents and individuals with specific risk factors or medical conditions, including HIV. To mitigate risk, the CDC and healthcare professionals advise getting vaccinated according to CDC guidelines, avoiding crowded and enclosed spaces, and seeking preventive antibiotics if exposed to someone with meningitis.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108969581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1388535,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/james-webb-space-telescope-expands-search-for-newborn-exoplanets/articleshow/108952856.cms|James Webb Space Telescope expands search for newborn exoplanets|NEW DELHI: Astronomers have turned their gaze towards protoplanetary disks using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). These disks, composed of dust and gas, swirl around developing stars, offering crucial insights into the early stages of planetary birth.While numerous such disks have been studied, only two planets have been directly observed during their formation.Now, researchers from the University of Michigan , University of Arizona , and University of Victoria have undertaken a series of studies, combining observations from JWST with data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, a press release by Eureka alert said.Their investigations, detailed in papers published in The Astronomical Journal, aimed to detect nascent planets within protoplanetary disks. As they develop, these young planets pick up mass in whirling masses of gas and dust known as protoplanetary disks. Though astronomers have observed several of these protoplanetary disks, they have only seen the planets in the process of formation on a few occasions as far."Several simulations suggest that the planet should be within the disk, massive, large, hot, and bright. But we didn't find it. This means that either the planet is much colder than we think, or it may be obscured by some material that prevents us from seeing it," said Gabriele Cugno of University of Michigan.One study led by the University of Michigan focused on SAO 206462, revealing a potential planet candidate. However, its exact nature remains uncertain, suggesting it could be obscured by material or mistaken for a faint background object.Similarly, studies led by the University of Victoria and the University of Arizona explored disks around stars HL Tau and MWC 758, respectively. While no new planets were detected, the observations provided unprecedented detail of the surrounding material, shedding light on the complex interplay between disks and their stellar hosts.The sensitivity of JWST's instruments allowed researchers to place stringent constraints on suspected planets, providing valuable insights into their properties and distribution within the disks. These findings are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems, offering clues about the distribution of chemical elements and the development of Earth-like worlds.Dr. Gabriele Cugno, emphasized the significance of detecting forming planets, stating, "If we manage to finally see these planets, we can connect some of the structures with forming companions and relate formation processes to the properties of other systems at much later stages."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108952850,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1177656,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The study assessed the impact of Covid-19 on the coverage of measles , rubella , humanpapillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis B, Meningitis A, and yellow fever vaccinations .Of these additional deaths, more than 30,000 are predicted from Africa and around 13,000 from Southeast Asia -- largely due to disruption to measles vaccine coverage. Globally, a little over 44,500 excess deaths are estimated to be due to the disruption to measles immunisation.The results highlighted the potential excess burden and opportunity for mitigation in the World Health Organization's (WHO) African and South-East Asia regions, especially for measles, the study said.The international team of researchers also estimated that catch-up activity can avert around 80 per cent of the excess deaths between 2023 and 2030."These estimates are the first of the effects of Covid-19 pandemic related coverage disruption on vaccine effects and implications for mitigation of excess burden since estimates of coverage declines were published," the authors wrote in the study.The researchers used modelling groups from the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium from 112 low- and middle-income countries to estimate vaccine effect for 14 disease-causing pathogens.The consortium, hosted out of Imperial College, UK, coordinates with research groups to model the impact of vaccination programmes worldwide, according to its website.The study results emphasised the importance of timely catch-up activities and interventions to address affected vaccine cohorts, the resreachers said.They also called for "continued global, concerted efforts" and "strong political commitment", which will be essential for overcoming existing challenges and increasing healthcare resilience.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108950368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-952066,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Describing the eclipse as something "that wasn't natural," Virts emphasized the unparalleled experience of witnessing a total eclipse, Mashable reported."On a scale of one to ten, a partial eclipse is a seven," said Virts, contrasting it with the magnificence of a total eclipse, which he rated as "a million.""If it is possible, make the effort and go see this thing," urged the former astronaut, underlining the significance of experiencing such an event.The upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8 promises not just a momentary plunge into darkness for those in the path of totality but also a rare opportunity to witness the sun's grandeur, including potential enormous explosions. This celestial event, taking viewers through seconds to minutes of totality, is the only occasion when gazing directly at the sun without protective eyewear is safe.When the moon moves in front of the sun and casts a shadow across the surface of the planet, this phenomenon is known as a solar eclipse. The sun, moon, and Earth must all be perfectly aligned for there to be a total eclipse. Because of the tilt between the moon's orbit around Earth and that of Earth around the sun, this alignment is unusual. Thus, from Earth's perspective, the moon typically travels above or below the sun.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108948820,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-10868,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/iit-madras-study-finds-an-increase-in-number-of-c-section-deliveries-across-india-between-2016-and-2021/articleshow/108946918.cms|IIT Madras Study finds an increase in number of C-section deliveries across India between 2016 and 2021|MUMBAI: Indian Institute of Technology Madras ( IIT Madras ) researchers have discovered a sharp uptick in the number of caesarean section (C-section) deliveries that took place across the country between 2016 and 2021.The study was undertaken by researchers from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Madras. They include Varshini Neethi Mohan and P Shirisha, Research Scholars, Girija Vaidyanathan and Prof.V R Muraleedharan.A caesarean section (C-section) delivery is a surgical technique that involves making an incision in the mother's belly to deliver one or more infants. When medically justified, the procedure can be lifesaving. When not strictly necessary, however, it can cause several adverse health outcomes, lead to unnecessary expenditure, and place a strain on scarce public health resources.Factors that could contribute to adverse birth outcomes and possibly justify C-sections (such as the mother’s age being less than 18 years or greater than 34 years, the interval between births being less than 24 months or the child being the fourth or more born to the mother) are considered high-risk fertility behaviour.In an in-depth analysis of Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh, the researchers found that despite the fact that both pregnancy complications and high-risk fertility behaviour were more prevalent in Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu had the higher prevalence of C-sections.Elaborating on the importance of these findings and its implications for health policymakers in the country, Prof. V R Muraleedharan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras, said, “A key finding was that the place of delivery (whether the delivery was in a public or a private facility) had the greatest impact on whether delivery was by C-section, implying that ‘clinical need’ factors were not necessarily the reason for surgical deliveries. Across India and Chhattisgarh, the non-poor were more likely to opt for C-sections, while in Tamil Nadu, the case was surprisingly different, as the poor were more likely to have C-sections in private hospitals.”The prevalence of C-sections across India increased from 17.2% to 21.5% in the five years leading up to 2021. In the private sector, these numbers stand at 43.1% (2016) and 49.7% (2021), meaning that nearly one in two deliveries in the private sector is a C-section.This increase could be attributed to several factors. The researchers found that better-educated women living in urban areas were more likely to deliver by C-section, suggesting that greater autonomy and better access to healthcare facilities play a role in the increase in prevalence of C-sections.The odds of a caesarean delivery among overweight women and those aged 35-49 were twice those for underweight women and those aged 15-24, respectively. The proportion of overweight women giving birth increased from 3% to 18.7%, while that of women aged 35-49 decreased slightly from 11.1% to 10.9%.Significantly, the proportion of those with pregnancy complications decreased from 42.2% to 39.5%, implying that the increased rate of C-section delivery was largely influenced by non-clinical factors. Women’s own preferences, their socio-economic level and education, and risk-averse physicians practising conservative medicine could be some of these non-clinical factors.Overall, in India, women delivering at private healthcare facilities were four times more likely to have a C-section over the period of study between 2016-2021. In Chhattisgarh, women had a ten-times higher chance of delivering by C-section in a private hospital while in Tamil Nadu, they had a three-times higher chance.This could be due to a lack of adequate infrastructure in public healthcare facilities, the researchers highlight – in Chhattisgarh, there was a 77% vacancy against the sanctioned posts for obstetricians and gynaecologists in 2021.To arrive at the above conclusions, the researchers collated and analysed data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015–2016 and 2019-21. The NFHS is a national survey which generates data on population and health indicators, especially on maternal and child health, which is conducted across India.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recommended rate for C-sections to be between 10% and 15%.The researchers recommend that “threshold levels for C-sections be applied cautiously, as several inter-category variations exist, and in states at advanced levels of demographic transition, need factors for C-sections may be more prevalent. There is an alarmingly high proportion of poor women undergoing C-sections in the private sector in Tamil Nadu. This requires further analysis and corrective action in case some of these are clinically unnecessary.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108947001,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-827406,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

NEW DELHI: Have you ever pondered your potential to join Nasa's ranks as an astronaut, a term rooted in the Greek for “star sailor”? As Nasa scouts for its latest class of astronauts, here’s a Myth-busting guide for aspirants:Fact: Despite the common belief, being a pilot is not a mandatory criterion to become an astronaut.Nasa values a diverse skill set among its astronaut corps. While flying experience can be advantageous, particularly for certain missions, Nasa also seeks candidates with strong backgrounds in engineering, science, medicine, and more. This diversity ensures a well-rounded crew capable of handling the multifaceted challenges of space missions.Fact: The Myth regarding perfect vision has deterred many potential applicants. However, Nasa's policy is inclusive of those who have undergone corrective eye surgeries such as PRK and LASIK. The key stipulation is that the surgery must have taken place at least one year prior to application, ensuring stability and no adverse long-term effects. This change reflects advancements in medical technology and a broader understanding of astronaut health and safety.Fact: Contrary to the belief that only PhD holders can become astronauts, Nasa requires a master's degree in a STEM field (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as the educational minimum. This requirement emphasizes the importance of a solid foundation in technical disciplines. However, exceptions are made for candidates with medical degrees or those who have graduated from test pilot schools, acknowledging the unique contributions these professionals can bring to astronaut missions.Fact: Nasa does not impose an age limit for astronaut candidates. The selection range in the past, from 26 to 46 years, with an average age of 34, illustrates the agency's flexibility. The focus is on the candidates' qualifications, experience, and physical fitness to withstand the rigors of space travel rather than their age.Fact: In terms of qualifications, becoming a Nasa astronaut requires not only a strong educational background and professional experience but also the physical and mental fortitude to undertake long-duration spaceflights. The comprehensive selection process ensures that only the most capable and adaptable candidates join the ranks of those who explore beyond our planet.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108932763,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1360461,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In the process of creating a programme to stop food allergies, researchers at National Jewish Health have discovered early indicators of the illness.Findings of the study published in the Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology's March 2024 issue, skin tape strips were taken from babies' forearms when they were just two months old--a time before any indication of a food allergy could be seen.The skin tape sampling method was created by experts at National Jewish Health, and it is soft and noninvasive for these very young patients. The lipids and surface proteins on the skin attach to the tape, which is subsequently removed to examine the specifics."We know that the immune system underneath the skin alters the skin barrier. With our painless skin tapes, we know if proteins sitting on the surface of the skin are abnormal," said Evgeny Berdyshev, PhD, a researcher at National Jewish Health and first author of the study. "If there were abnormal lipids and abnormal proteins on the skin, that is an early sign of what can eventually lead to atopic dermatitis and food allergies.""Ultimately, we want to identify people at risk for food allergy and address skin barrier abnormalities early to prevent the development of these conditions," said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology in the Department of Pediatrics at National Jewish Health, and senior author of the study."This is just the first step," said Dr. Leung. "We now have a biomarker for atopic dermatitis and food allergy - the abnormality is abnormal lipids, microbes and proteins. We are now testing newborn babies to determine whether we can prevent this abnormality. We put a lipid cream on the skin of the study participants, so it hopefully can penetrate the skin and infuse it with fatty acids. We are working to develop an anti-inflammatory cream as a result of this study."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108923584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21604,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/drugs-need-to-be-modified-before-lupus-patients-plan-pregnancy-doctors/articleshow/108914054.cms|Drugs need to be modified before lupus patients plan pregnancy: Doctors|NEW DELHI: Women suffering from lupus can safely become pregnant and also breastfeed their newborns but the pregnancies need to be planned in consultation with doctors so that the drugs can be modified well in advance, according to experts at the AIIMS here. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease that affects mostly women in their reproductive age.It can involve any organ of the body and, if not treated, can be life-threatening also.Dr Ranjan Gupta, Associate Professor in the Department of Rheumatology at AIIMS Delhi, said pregnancy is a major concern among lupus patients coming to the hospital as they are mostly women in their child-bearing age group.The problem is further compounded by the fact that the medicines used in the treatment of SLE can cause deformities in children if taken during conception. Therefore, an unplanned pregnancy can be a physical and emotional challenge for these patients, Dr Gupta said."On the other hand, if pregnancies are planned well in consultation with their rheumatologists according to the disease state, the drugs can be modified well in advance and women patients with SLE can not only have successful pregnancy but can also breastfeed their newborns," he said on the sidelines of an event at AIIMS, Delhi.The drugs that are usually used to treat SLE like mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide are deformity causing drugs in the developing foetus and need to be changed much in advance of conception.At a patient education program themed 'Patients with Lupus also can lead a normal life' organised at AIIMS, Delhi for SLE patients on Saturday, doctors highlighted that regular follow-up with uninterrupted treatment is the key for long-term remission in this chronic rheumatic disease.Dr Gupta emphasised on early recognition of this disease by general physicians as most of the patients already accrue irreversible damage before reaching big institutes. He also called for a strong family and emotional support for these patients.Dr Siddharth Jain, assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, pointed towards strong female preponderance of this disease, mostly in their child bearing age which adversely impacts not just the patient but the family as well.Early detection followed by regular treatment is the key to favourable long-term prognosis, he stressed."These patients also can lead a normal life provided they visit their doctors regularly and continue the prescribed treatment. Most of the time, the disease flares are the outcomes of non-compliance," Dr Jain said.Almost 80 patients attended the programme which was inaugurated by the Dean (Academics) Dr Kaushal Verma and Head of the Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics Dr D K Mitra.Dermatologist Dr Neetu Bhari discussed the skin manifestations and their management whereas psychiatrist Dr Rohit Verma highlighted the under-recognised issue of depression among lupus patients. Nephrologist Dr Arun Kumar discussed the renal involvement in SLE.Several lupus patients presented the inspiring journey of their fight with this disease, at times with little family support.A nationwide programme INSPIRE, which is a cohort of 2,500 SLE patients across India in 10 institutes under the leadership of Dr Amita Agarwal, Head of Department of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology at SGPGIMS, Lucknow, has been studying this disease in Indian patients since 2018.Almost 60 per cent patients from this cohort found their telephonic conversation with the researchers of this project helpful in managing their disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr Gupta said.Symptoms of the SLE include fever, oral ulcers, skin rashes, joint pain, hair fall and kidney involvement.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108914773,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11628,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Visible for 185 days, this celestial event left behind a nebula known as Pa 30 in the constellation Cassiopeia, challenging scientists for centuries to uncover its secrets.Historical accounts describe the supernova as a temporary star , rivalling the brightness of Saturn, yet its remnant eluded identification until recently.Initially thought to be associated with the pulsar 3C 58, it was the discovery of Pa 30 that directed astronomers to the true aftermath of the explosion. Combining data across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-ray observations from ESA's XMM-Newton and Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, with infrared light captured by Nasa’s Wide-field Infrared Space Explorer, researchers have pieced together a stunning image of the remnant.This composite image, enhanced by the heated sulfur's radial structure glowing in visible light from the MDM Observatory in Arizona and background stars captured by Pan-STARRS in Hawaii, offers a vibrant view into the past. At the heart of this cosmic spectacle lies a 'zombie' star, a white dwarf resulting from the merger of two other dwarfs, propelling stellar winds at incredible speeds. This discovery sheds light on the rare sub-luminous Type Iax supernovae, typically leaving no remnant behind.Beyond its breathtaking beauty, the Pa 30 nebula and its central white dwarf star offer astronomers a unique laboratory for studying the mechanics of thermonuclear explosions in the cosmos. The remnant's study provides insights into the evolution of stars, the dynamics of supernova explosions, and the intricate tapestry of our galaxy's history.Managed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Chandra X-ray Center, this research underscores the ongoing mission to unravel the mysteries of the universe. As one of the hottest stars in the Milky Way, the central star of Pa 30 continues to intrigue scientists with its extraordinary characteristics and the spectacular nebula it illuminates.The latest findings from Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory not only offer a visual feast but also an invaluable glimpse into the cosmic events that shape our universe. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of space, discoveries like the remnant of the 1181 supernova remind us of the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the cosmos.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108875663,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-640895,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The spacecraft also discovered that Selam, Dinkinesh's natural satellite, which upon closer inspection, was found to be two objects fused together.By examining the significant craters on the space rocks , scientists have estimated Dinkinesh to be around 7 million years old and Selam approximately 2 million years old.They find it fascinating that Dinkinesh and Selam exhibit only a minor age gap (in cosmic terms, 5 million years is negligible compared to the age of our 4.5-billion-year-old solar system)."This could tell us something fundamental about the formation of these objects and possibly different processes are responsible for Dinkinesh and Selam," said Marchi, the deputy principal investigator of the mission at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Texas.The encounter with Dinkinesh was initially meant as an engineering test for Lucy's tracking system. However, the spacecraft exceeded expectations, providing remarkably clear images throughout the flyby. Scientists from the SwRI shared their findings at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), revealing that Dinkinesh and Selam exhibit similar characteristics, suggesting they are likely remnants of larger celestial bodies , Space.com reported.John Spencer, the mission's deputy project scientist said, "We totally blew those requirements out of the water." "We had pin sharp images all the way through the encounter," he added.The study of these asteroids also sheds light on phenomena such as the "YORP effect," where solar radiation causes slight thrust, altering the rotation of space rocks. Additionally, the Lucy mission, launched in 2021, is poised to explore more Trojan asteroids, aiming to uncover insights into the solar system's formation and the origins of life on Earth.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108877196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22682,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This rare event occurs when the Moon completely obscures the Sun, offering a unique spectacle . However, it's crucial to view it safely. Here's what you should avoid:: Proper eye protection is essential. Standard sunglasses won't suffice.Use eclipse glasses or handheld solar viewers that meet the ISO 12312-2 international standard. Only during totality can you safely view the eclipse without protection.: Viewing the Sun through cameras, telescopes, or binoculars, even with eclipse glasses, can cause serious injury . The concentrated solar rays can damage the eyes.: If driving, use the car's visor instead of wearing eclipse glasses to block the Sun.: The eclipse's path of totality might tempt you to travel. Be aware that this can lead to congested roads and, in some cases, necessitate early dismissals from schools and other precautionary measures in anticipation of increased traffic.: It's unsafe to attempt watching the eclipse or capturing it on camera while driving. Find a safe location to park and then enjoy the event.To safely watch a solar eclipse, follow these essential guidelines:: Regular sunglasses, even if they are very dark, are not safe for looking at the sun. Instead, wear eclipse glasses or use handheld solar viewers. These should comply with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard.: Before the eclipse, check your glasses for any scratches, punctures, or damages. If they are damaged, do not use them.: You can only safely remove your eclipse glasses during the brief period of totality when the moon completely covers the sun. Before and after totality, when the sun is partially visible, you must use your eclipse glasses.: If you plan to view the eclipse through a camera, a telescope, or binoculars, ensure these devices have solar filters designed for this purpose. Do not attempt to view the solar eclipse through these devices using just your eclipse glasses, as the concentrated solar rays can damage the filters and enter your eyes, causing serious injury.: Make sure that any children viewing the eclipse are properly using their eclipse glasses and understand the importance of not removing them outside of totality.: Do not attempt to watch the eclipse without proper eye protection at any point outside of the totality phase. Even brief exposure to the sun’s rays can cause permanent eye damage.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108873802,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-263303,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Earlier, Skyroot had conducted the remarkable suborbital space launch of India's first private rocket Vikram-S in Nov 2022.The test, which lasted 85 seconds, recorded a peak sea-level thrust of 186 kilonewtons (kN), which will translate to a fully expanded vacuum thrust of around 235kN in flight. The Kalam-250 is a high-strength carbon composite rocket motor, which uses solid fuel and a high-performance ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers thermal protection system. Skyroot had previously tested Kalam-100, the third stage of Vikram-1, which was test-fired successfully in June 2021.Skyroot co-founder and CEO Pawan Chandana said, “This is a significant milestone for the Indian space industry, marking the successful test of the largest propulsion system ever designed and manufactured by the Indian private sector so far, and the first carbon-composite-built motor tested at Isro. All test parameters are within expected bounds, and this achievement takes us another step closer to the upcoming orbital launch of the Vikram-1 rocket .”The test also had an important contribution from Isro’s centre Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which supplied its proprietary head-mounted safe arm for the test, used for the safe operation of the rocket stage, a company’s release said.Naga Bharath Daka, co-founder and COO of Skyroot, said, “In this landmark test, we validated the critical system for the launch — the flex nozzle control system — during firing for the first time, making this an important milestone in our journey. We have a few more milestones to cross and are focused on achieving them in the coming months to reach our maiden orbital launch of the Vikram-1 in 2024.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108864738,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1547250,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This celestial event, taking viewers through seconds to minutes of totality, is the only occasion when gazing directly at the sun without protective eyewear is safe.According to a report in Live Science, during this eclipse, spectators may be treated to the sight of dark-pink prominences—towering loops of plasma extending far into space, beyond many times the Earth's diameter."These prominences will almost certainly be on show during totality in North America on April 8, because the sun is likely at the peak of its 11-year solar cycle," said Alyssa Pagan, a science visuals developer at the Space Telescope Science Institute.Observers might also spot coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares—explosive manifestations of the sun's magnetic energy. "If we get lucky, a CME will present itself as a twisted, spiral-like structure, high in the atmosphere in the sun," noted solar physicist Ryan French. While solar flares , often following CMEs, unleash vast amounts of energy, their sighting during totality is considered less likely.The eclipse offers a unique viewing platform for "giant eruptive" prominences, particularly spectacular if detached and floating within the corona. "There have been a few examples of such prominence eruptions over the past few months, each of which would have given a great show if occurring during a total solar eclipse," French explained.To capture these transient solar events, efforts like the Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE 2024) project aim to create a prolonged observation period. By coordinating a continent-wide observation effort, scientists hope to capture the beginning or end of these solar phenomena, extending the window of totality beyond its brief natural duration.As anticipation builds for the April 8 solar eclipse, both casual observers and scientific communities are poised to witness potentially one of the most dynamic displays of solar activity coinciding with this rare astronomical event.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108843050,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-500180,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This increase has moved colorectal cancer up to being the top cause of cancer deaths in men under the age of 50 and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women under 50 in the United States.Colon and rectal cancers share many similarities and are typically lumped into one category, called colorectal cancer. Studies, however, show that the increase in diagnoses is mainly driven by a rise in rectal cancers and cancers found in the left, or distal, side of the colon, near the rectum. "That maybe provides an important clue for understanding what might be going on," said Caitlin Murphy, an associate professor and cancer researcher at UTHealth Houston.When cancer is found at a younger-than-usual age, doctors usually suspect that genetic mutations may be to blame. And some molecular studies suggest that tumors in early-onset colorectal cancers do have different mutations driving the cancer compared with tumors in older adults. Another piece of evidence that there is a genetic component: It is clear that having a first-degree relative who had colorectal cancer -- or even a precancerous polyp -- can increase your risk, Cecchini said. But genetic changes do not explain the full picture, he said.Some research has linked lifestyle and dietary changes to increased rates of colorectal cancer in both young people and older adults.Experts are beginning to investigate if there are other environmental drivers of early-onset cancer. For instance, some small studies have hinted at the idea that people who develop colorectal cancer at an early age have an imbalance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in their gut.Some experts believe exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment may also be to blame.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108847211,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1701106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

However, the vibrant hues seen in images from the JWST, ranging from the Southern Ring Nebula's blue and gold to Cassiopeia A's pink, orange, and purple, raise the question: Do these celestial bodies truly possess these colors?Alyssa Pagan, a science visuals developer at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), explains, "The quickest answer is, we don't know," highlighting the inherent limitations of human perception in observing the universe's true colors.JWST operates in the infrared spectrum, capturing wavelengths beyond what the human eye can perceive, which challenges our conventional understanding of color in the cosmos.As per a Space.com report, the JWST utilizes multiple filters to view its targets in various infrared wavelengths, which initially produce black and white images. These images are later colorized by translating the data into the spectrum of visible light. "The longest wavelengths appear red, while the shorter wavelengths are blue or purple," Pagan notes, bridging the gap between the unseen and the visible.While the colors added to JWST images may not reflect the actual hues of celestial objects, they serve a vital role in making the data "scientifically digestible and also engaging," according to Pagan. This process helps highlight specific features of interest and can guide scientists to new areas of research, such as the early universe's distant objects revealed in JWST's deep-field view, the Space.com report said.By contrasting images from the JWST with those from visual-light telescopes like Hubble, we gain a unique perspective on familiar cosmic landmarks. For instance, the Pillars of Creation appear markedly different in infrared, revealing hidden star formation and showing portions of gas and dust as transparent, which are obscured in the visual spectrum.Though we may not see the universe's true colors with our eyes, the JWST's images provide a profound understanding of the celestial wonders surrounding us, merging aesthetics with science to explore the depths of space.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108843369,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1534861,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"If the environment continues to be ignored, then we will continue to reap ecological disasters."A vast tropical archipelago stretching across the equator, Indonesia is home to the world's third-largest rainforest, with a variety of endangered wildlife and plants, including orangutans, elephants, giant and blooming forest flowers. Some live nowhere else.For generations the forests have also provided livelihoods, food, and medicine while playing a central role in cultural practices for millions of Indigenous residents in Indonesia.Since 1950, more than 74 million hectares (285,715 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest - an area twice the size of Germany - have been logged, burned or degraded for development of palm oil, paper and rubber plantations, mining and other commodities according to Global Forest Watch.Indonesia is the biggest producer of palm oil, one of the largest exporters of coal and a top producer of pulp for paper. It also exports oil and gas, rubber, tin and other resources. And it also has the world's largest reserves of nickel - a critical material for electric vehicles, solar panels and other goods needed for the green energy transition.Indonesia has consistently ranked as one of the largest global emitters of plant-warming greenhouse gases, with its emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and peatland fires, according to the Global Carbon Project.It's also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts , including extreme events such as floods and droughts, long-term changes from sea level rise, shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures, according to the World Bank. In recent decades the country has already seen the effects of climate change: More intense rains, landslides and floods during rainy season, and more fires during a longer dry season.But forests can help play a vital role in reducing the impact of some extreme weather events, said Aida Greenbury, a sustainability expert focusing on Indonesia.Flooding can be slowed by trees and vegetation soaking up rainwater and reducing erosion. In dry season, forests release moisture that helps mitigate the effects of droughts, including fires.But when forests diminish, those benefits do as well.A 2017 study reported that forest conversion and deforestation expose bare soil to rainfall, causing soil erosion. Frequent harvesting activities - such as done on palm oil plantations - and the removal of ground vegetation leads to further soil compaction, causing rain to run off the surface instead of entering groundwater reservoirs. Downstream erosion also increases sediment in rivers, making rivers shallower and increasing flood risks, according to the research.After the deadly floods in Sumatra in early March, West Sumatra Gov. Mahyeldi Ansharullah said there were strong indications of illegal logging around locations affected by floods and landslides. That, coupled with extreme rainfall, inadequate drainage systems and improper housing development contributed to the disaster, he said.Experts and environmental activists have pointed to deforestation worsening disasters in other regions of Indonesia as well: In 2021 environmental activists partially blamed deadly floods in Kalimantan on environmental degradation caused by large-scale mining and palm oil operations. In Papua, deforestation was partially blamed for floods and landslides that killed over a hundred people in 2019.There have been some signs of progress: In 2018 Indonesian President Joko Widodo put a three-year freeze on new permits for palm oil plantations. And the rate of deforestation slowed between 2021-2022, according to government data.But experts warn that it's unlikely deforestation in Indonesia will stop anytime soon as the government continues to move forward with new mining and infrastructure projects such as new nickel smelters and cement factories."A lot of land use and land-based investment permits have already been given to businesses, and a lot of these areas are already prone to disasters," said Arie Rompas, an Indonesia-based forestry expert at Greenpeace.President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who is scheduled to take office in October, has promised to continue Widodo's policy of development, include large-scale food estates, mining and other infrastructure development that are all linked to deforestation.Environmental watchdogs also warn that environmental protections in Indonesia are weakening, including the passing of the controversial Omnibus Law, which eliminated an article of the Forestry Law regarding the minimum area of forest that must be maintained at development projects."The removal of that article makes us very worried (about deforestation) for the years to come," said Rompas.While experts and activists recognize that development is essential for Indonesia's economy to continue to go, they argue that it should be done in a way that considers the environment and incorporates better land planning."We can't continue down the same path we've been on," said sustainability expert Greenbury.

The study is published in the journal PLoS Climate.The findings showed that emotional investment can help raise awareness of important issues and galvanise an otherwise apathetic public, they said.For example, individuals and organisations advocating for proactive climate solutions might appeal to feelings of hope, they said.For the study, the researchers used surveys to examine how common emotional reactions to climate change -- guilt, anger, hope, sadness and fear -- influenced one's policy preferences.The survey questions enquired about the respondents' emotional response to climate change, and support for specific policies - for example, "Increase federal funding to low-income communities and communities of colour who are disproportionately harmed by air and water pollution."The surveys were distributed every six months from 2010 to 2022.Of the total 16,605 participants, 51 per cent reported as being women and 73 per cent as being "White, non-Hispanic". On average, they were aged 45-54 years and had received "some college" education. The questions accounted for political ideologies as well, the team said.They found that the five emotions investigated were uniquely associated with support for specific types of climate policies - taxes or investments or regulatory ones. However, the stronger the emotionality, the stronger the support for any policy, they found."We find that in comparison to other policy options: those who are more fearful of climate change are more likely to support regulatory-first approaches to policy; those who feel more guilty support personally costly climate policies; and those who are more hopeful support more proactive climate policies like generating renewable energy on public land," the authors wrote in their study."Future work should examine experimentally whether messages that target these emotions are more effective at increasing support for the specific policy types, but in the meantime, communicators may wish to consider how their campaign's emotional tones match their targeted policy goals," they wrote.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108912427,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1130386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Whales - or tohora, as Maori call them - guided their ancestors across the Pacific Ocean. Today, those groups consider themselves to be guardians for the largest animals under the sea.But as of Wednesday, whales are not simply animals in this region.Indigenous leaders of New Zealand, Tahiti and the Cook Islands signed a historic treaty that recognises whales as legal persons in a move conservationists believe will apply pressure to national govts to offer greater protections for the large mammals. "It's fitting that the traditional guardians are initiating this," said Mere Takoko, a Maori conservationist who leads Hinemoana Halo Ocean Initiative, the group that spearheaded the treaty.Conservationists have good reason to believe they will succeed: In 2017, New Zealand passed a groundbreaking law that granted personhood status to the Whanganui River because of its importance to Maori, New Zealand's indigenous people. The treaty, or He Whakaputanga Moana (declaration for the ocean), was signed on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands, in a ceremony attended by Tuheitia Potatau te Wherowhero VII, the Maori king, and 15 paramount chiefs of Tahiti and the Cook Islands. The Maori king said as "the songs of our ancestor" grow fainter, the treaty "is not merely words on paper". "It's a Hinemoana Halo, a woven cloak of protection for our taonga, our treasures - the magnificent whales," he said.The significance of whales to indigenous groups is twofold. First, they believe they can trace their ancestry directly back to whales, and second, whales were key to developing the Maori system of navigation as people followed whale migrations from island to island. "Without the whale, we would have never found all of these various islands," Takoko said.While climate change is considered a significant threat to whales, encounters with large vessels can be fatal. About 10,000 whales are killed every year because of ship strikes.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108888404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1687125,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In an interaction with philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , he also said that climate action has gained momentum since the G20 Summit in India last September.When Gates asked if the green approach could be made more affordable for easier adoption, Modi said the world needs to adopt a two-pronged strategy: first, nature and climate-friendly innovation, and second, environmentally-friendly lifestyles.The prime minister said, "Our current challenge is how we perceive progress. For example, a country's development is often judged by its steel consumption and energy usage. Based on these criteria, we calculate the country's economy.""If we continue to rely on these parameters, we will consume more electricity and steel, resulting in increased carbon emissions. This means we need to change our mindset. We need to make lifestyle choices and measure progress in ways that are climate-friendly. Currently, all our measures of progress are detrimental to the climate," he said.Modi suggested that the world adopt the concept of green GDP which would be incorporated into the overall gross domestic product. "We need to change the global terminology," he said.Green GDP is an alternative metric for gauging economic growth which takes into consideration the environmental consequences linked to economic activities.The prime minister said that if "we continue to consume excessively and waste electricity and water", theclimate change problem cannot be solved.He noted that his and Gates' perspectives on climate change closely align.The philanthropist praised Modi's " Mission Innovation " launched at the 2015 Paris climate meeting."Mission Innovation", termed by Modi, involves collaboration among 23 countries and the European Commission (on behalf of the European Union) to accelerate the clean energy revolution and progress towards the Paris Agreement goals and pathways to net zero. India is a founding member of "Mission Innovation".Gates said the world will probably miss the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and even the "2 degrees Celsius goal is not going to be easy".Global average temperatures have risen by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1850, exacerbating climate impacts, with 2023 being the hottest on record.The greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution, is closely tied to it.The prime minister said that post-G20, an atmosphere has been created where everyone has resolved to fulfil their responsibilities towards climate.He told Gates that India is making rapid advancements in the renewable energy sector."Our efforts are focused on solar and wind energy. And, we are also eager to accelerate progress in the nuclear sector. Similarly, our ambitions extend to making significant progress in green hydrogen," he said.The G20 Summit held here last year concluded with the major economies agreeing to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which is also one of the key outcomes of the UN climate conference held in Dubai in December.Modi also said his government is promoting innovation in sunrise sectors through Rs 1 lakh corpus fund to youth and interest-free loan for up to 50 years to work on futuristic technologies.Discussing India's rich history of environmental conservation, the prime minister said recycling and reusing are inherent to the nature of Indian people and their ethos.He informed Gates that the jacket he was wearing was made of recycled materials.Gates said consumers should prefer clean products "when they are buying a car or when they are buying any product"."Changing their food consumption, even if they don't go all the way to be a vegetarian, they can eat less beef, more chicken, or less chicken and more fish, they can moderate quite a bit, and we know that it also has some health benefits as well," he said.To this, Modi said that even a vegetarian diet needs improvement and this can be done through the inclusion of millets."We celebrated 2023 as the 'Year of Millets' with the UN. Millets have great benefits. They grow in barren land, need minimal water, and don't require fertilisers. They are a superfood. Promoting millet can be a big step forward," he said.Even with vegetarian options, some choices are more harmful, he added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108881656,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Spare a thought for the world's timekeepers, who are trying to work out how climate change is affecting Earth's rotation - and in turn, how we keep track of time. In a strange twist, global warming could even help out timekeepers by delaying the need for history's first "negative leap second" by three years, a study published on Wednesday suggested.Experts fear that introducing a negative leap second - a minute with only 59 seconds - into standard time could cause havoc on computer systems across the world.For most of history, time was measured by the rotation of the Earth. However in 1967, the world's timekeepers embraced atomic clocks - ushering in a more precise era of timekeeping. But sailors, who still relied on the Sun and stars for navigation, and others wanted to retain the connection between Earth's rotation and time. There was a problem. Our planet is an unreliable clock, and had long been rotating slower than atomic time, meaning the two measurements were out of sync. So a compromise was struck. Whenever the difference between the two measurements approached 0.9 of a second, a "leap second" was added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the internationally agreed standard by which the world sets its clocks.Though most people likely have not noticed, 27 leap seconds have been added to UTC since 1972, the last coming in 2016. But in recent years a new problem has emerged that few saw coming: Earth's rotation has been speeding up, overtaking atomic time. This means that to bring the two measurements in sync, timekeepers may have to introduce the first ever negative leap second. "This has never happened before, and poses a major challenge to making sure that all parts of the global timing infrastructure show the same time," said Duncan Agnew, a researcher at the University of California.He determined that if not for climate change, a negative leap second might have needed to be added to UTC as soon as 2026. But starting from 1990, melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has slowed down the Earth's rotation, the study said. This has delayed the need for a negative leap second until at least 2029, it added. Demetrios Matsakis, ex-chief scientist for time services at US Naval Observatory who was not involved in the study, said he was sceptical of Agnew's analysis.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108860006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1287253,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

This adjustment could lead to the world's clocks losing a second within the next few years, a direct result of human activity.According to the report, the Earth's rotation, which dictates the hours and minutes of our day, is not constant.Factors such as changes on Earth's surface and activity in its molten core can cause slight variations. These variations sometimes necessitate the adjustment of the world's timekeeping systems by a leap second. While the addition of seconds has been a common practice to align with Earth's slowing rotation , the current acceleration in rotation speed signifies that, for the first time, a second will need to be subtracted, a CNN report said.Patrizia Tavella, from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France, highlighted the novelty and potential complications of this adjustment, saying, “A negative leap second has never been added or tested, so the problems it could create are without precedent.”The study, published in the journal Nature, attributes the delay of this leap second, from 2026 to 2029, to the effects of global warming. The melting polar ice is causing a redistribution of mass, with meltwater moving from the poles towards the equator, further slowing the Earth's rotation. Duncan Agnew, a professor of geophysics at the University of California San Diego and author of the study, emphasized, “Part of figuring out what is going to happen in global timekeeping … is dependent on understanding what is happening with the global warming effect.”Despite the significant impact of polar ice melt on Earth's rotation, the report also points to processes within the Earth's core as a contributing factor to the overall acceleration of the planet's rotation. The core's independent spin affects the rotation of the Earth's solid outer shell. Agnew explains, "If the core slows down, the solid shell speeds up to maintain momentum," leading to the current situation where a second may need to be subtracted from global timekeeping systems, the CNN report said.This phenomenon not only has implications for our understanding of Earth's geophysical processes but also poses practical challenges for computing systems reliant on precise timekeeping, such as those used in stock exchanges.Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, remarked on the significance of these findings, emphasizing that the core's changes are now surpassing the effects of polar ice loss. “It’s a ‘yikes’ moment for some computer applications,” he said, highlighting the complexity of adjusting to these changes.This study underscores the profound ways in which human-induced climate change is affecting our planet, extending even to the fundamental aspect of time itself. Agnew hopes the findings will help people grasp the magnitude of global warming's impact, stating, “Being able to say so much ice has melted that it’s actually changed the rotation of the Earth by a measurable amount, I think gives you the sense, OK, this is a big deal.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108842310,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1445780,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The country-wise food waste data confirms that such waste is not just a ‘rich country’ problem, with levels of household food waste differing in observed average levels for high-income, upper-middle, and lower-middle-income countries by just 7 kg per capita.At the same time, hotter countries appear to generate more food waste per capita in households, potentially due to higher consumption of fresh foods with substantial inedible parts and a lack of robust cold chains.This is the second such report of UNEP after the first one in 2021 that factored in the food waste in the year 2019. Its comparison with the latest one, released on Wednesday, shows that the per capita per year food waste at household level globally increased from 74kg in 2019 to 79 kg in 2022. Similarly, it increased in India from 50 kg/capita/year to 55 kg/capita/year during the same period. Per capita per year food waste at household level was the highest in Maldives at 207 kg/capita/year in 2022.“Food waste is a global tragedy. Millions will go hungry today as food is wasted across the world. Not only is this a major development issue, but the impacts of such unnecessary waste are causing substantial costs to the climate and nature,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP.According to recent data, food loss and waste generates 8-10% of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – almost 5 times that of the aviation sector – and significant biodiversity loss by taking up the equivalent of almost a third of the world’s agricultural land.Still, only 21 countries have included food loss and/or waste reduction in their national climate plans - called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - under the Paris Agreement. Besides, only four G20 countries (Australia, Japan, UK, the USA) and the European Union have food waste estimates suitable for tracking progress to 2030.In this context, the Food Waste Index report may serve as a practical guide for countries to consistently measure and report food waste, and also try to integrate it in their next round of NDCs in 2025 to raise their climate ambition.Currently, many low- and middle-income countries continue to lack adequate systems for even tracking progress to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of halving food waste by 2030, particularly in retail and food services.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108834381,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-930809,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Recipients of the funding, which is coming from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, include 33 demonstration projects in more than 20 states.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said during a call with news media that the technologies being funded are "replicable," "scalable," and will "set a new gold standard for clean manufacturing in the United States and around the world." White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said this funding aims to eliminate 14 million metric tons of pollution each year, equivalent to taking about 3 million cars off the road.Century Aluminum Company plans to build the first new US primary aluminum smelter in 45 years. The plant would double the size of the current US primary aluminum industry while avoiding an estimated 75% of emissions from a traditional facility, with its energy-efficient design and use of clean energy, according to DOE.Constellium in Ravenswood, West Virginia, is going to operate a first-of-its-kind zero-carbon aluminum casting plant and install low-emission furnaces that can use clean fuels such as hydrogen. The company produces aluminum for a range of products including cars and planes.Kraft Heinz will install heat pumps, electric heaters and electric boilers to decarbonize food production at 10 facilities, including in Holland, Michigan.Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio, will retire one blast furnace, install two electric furnaces, and use hydrogen-based ironmaking technology. The project aims to eliminate 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year from the largest supplier of steel to the U.S. automotive industry.Heidelberg Materials US, Inc. will build a system that captures and stores carbon underground at its plant in Mitchell, Indiana. The project aims to capture at least 95% of the carbon dioxide released by the cement plant, which will prevent 2 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year."I think the United States can be a leader here," said Mike Ireland, president and CEO of the Portland Cement Association, a non-profit that promotes cement and concrete. Ireland said the innovative cement and concrete technologies being scaled in the US can be adopted by developing countries in the Global South to build highways and buildings in a more sustainable way.There are not many US plants that manufacture virgin steel, and even fewer make virgin aluminum, so tackling emissions at even just a few facilities could make an outsized contribution to reducing the country's carbon footprint, said Todd Tucker at the Roosevelt Institute, the nonprofit partner of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. Once the methods for decarbonizing are proven, the technology could be exported globally for a more dynamic climate benefit, added Tucker, the think tank's director of industrial policy and trade.Decarbonizing the electricity and transportation sectors has been at the center of the climate conversation and there are generous federal subsidizes for the solutions, mainly using renewable energy for power generation and adopting electric vehicles, Tucker said.But he noted it's harder to cut emissions in heavy industries that rely on fossils fuels for creating the high heat and chemical reactions needed for their operations."Getting this off the ground with these first few projects is going to be really useful for convincing industry that this transition is possible, and also, importantly, convincing Wall Street that this transition is possible," Tucker said. "The first trick is showing it's viable in one project. Once you do that, then the private and public sectors can come up with strategies for the rest of the problem."The production of new aluminum in the U.S. has been precipitously declining in recent decades, especially the past few years, largely because of energy costs, said Annie Sartor, aluminum director at the green industry advocacy organization Industrious Labs. The process uses a tremendous amount of electricity that's about 40% of the cost, Sartor said."These facilities have historically been located near chefossil energy. And today, 21st century coal, or coal and gas, are no longer cheapest," she said. "These facilities that are reliant on fossil energy to operate can't compete in the global market for aluminum. And they're closing."The investment for Century Aluminum Company is game-changing, Sartor said, because shifting to producing new aluminum with 100% clean energy will help the climate, stabilize the industry and create jobs.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108790760,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1413421,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Other parts of the US dig out|A major spring storm threatened parts of the central US on Monday with heavy snow in its northern reaches and thunderstorms and possible tornadoes in the South.Other parts of the country tried to recover from their own severe weather , from hail and flooding in California to heavy snow, freezing rain and flooding in the Northeast, where some areas were not expected to get power back until Tuesday or beyond.The storm Monday is expected to bring strong winds, sleet and freezing rain and snow through Tuesday from a broad swath from the Dakotas to the Gulf Coast. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of South Dakota and Nebraska.There is a greater than 70% chance of at least 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow from central South Dakota to northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. Snow could fall at a rate of 2 inches (5 centimeters) per hour, it said.Heavy snow had already fallen Sunday in Minnesota, where the state patrol reported more than 300 crashes, at least one of them fatal. A total of 8.2 inches was recorded at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport Sunday, breaking the old record for the date of 6.8 inches (17.2 centimeters) in 1996.The snow turned into rain early Monday in Minneapolis, making for a slushy morning commute.Severe thunderstorms with a threat for tornadoes and other damaging winds were possible in east Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Strong storms, some producing tornado warnings, had already made their way through parts of Oklahoma and Texas on Sunday night.Police across the Northeast reported hundreds of traffic accidents over the weekend as cars spun out and drivers grappled with icy roads. New York City, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston also saw heavy rain and flooding.Airlines were catching up after the combination of sleet, freezing rain and wet, heavy snow delayed and canceled flights.Heavy snow buried Vermont, New Hampshire and most of Maine over the weekend, dumping more than 2 feet (0.6 meters) in some areas, toppling trees, causing car crashes and cutting power.Tens of thousands of people from Maine to New York remained without power early Monday.In New York City, where more than 3.5 inches (9 centimeters) of rain fell, floodwaters snarled subway service, closed part of a major parkway and trapped motorists on flooded roads in Central Park. On Fifth Avenue, a giant tree fell over several cars, prompting a road closure.In Lodi, New Jersey, river flooding inundated roads.Snow also fell Sunday night over parts of northern Arizona, the Grand Canyon and Flagstaff.Heavy rain and quarter-size hail fell in Southern California on Sunday. A 35-year-old woman was rescued after being swept away in the storm-swollen Los Angeles River, fire officials said.

This unique trait, previously shrouded in mystery, has been potentially unraveled by recent scientific research .This research involved the genetic analysis of numerous pandas both in the wild and in captivity, revealing that the rare brown-and-white coloration is likely due to natural genetic variation rather than the result of inbreeding, as was once speculated, a CNN report said.Dandan, the first brown panda identified in 1985 in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi province, sparked curiosity and subsequent sightings have been recorded, totaling eleven over the years. These sightings have led researchers to believe that the brown coloration could be inheritable, though its genetic basis remained elusive until now.The study, published in the journal PNAS, took a closer look at Qizai, a male brown panda found in 2009 and currently the only one of his color in captivity. Examination of Qizai and comparison with black-and-white pandas revealed differences in melanosome structure and size, essential for skin and hair pigmentation, the CNN report said.Further genetic investigation linked Qizai, his parents, and his offspring through a recessive trait identified on the Bace2 gene, pinpointing a specific mutation responsible for the brown fur, found only in pandas from the Qinling Mountains.Researchers utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology on lab mice to confirm the role of this genetic alteration, observing similar changes in coat color, supporting the theory that the same mutation affects panda fur color.The mutation's origin is attributed to the unique environment of the Qinling Mountains rather than inbreeding, highlighting the role of natural variation in species' physical traits.This discovery, shedding light on the genetic makeup behind the brown coloration of certain giant pandas, not only enriches our understanding of panda genetics but also aids in the broader efforts of species conservation and management, especially given the vulnerable status of the giant panda. The research represents a significant step in our comprehension of biodiversity and the intricate workings of genetics in the animal kingdom.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108762825,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1200190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/saved-from-whaling-blue-whales-now-face-threat-from-global-warming-human-activities-study/articleshow/108733015.cms|Saved from whaling, blue whales now face threat from global warming, human activities: Study|NEW DELHI: Blue whales , the largest living animals, have recovered from being hunted, only to face the growing challenges from global warming and other human threats like underwater noise, pollution and disrupted food sources, according to a new stocktake of their population .Researchers found the greatest genetic differences among the blue whale populations in the eastern Pacific, Antarctic subspecies and the pygmy subspecies of the eastern Indian and western Pacific.Blue whales average about 27 metres in length.Natural selection could be one of the reasons behind these differences, they said."Each of these groups need to be conserved to maintain biodiversity in the species, and there are indications that natural selection in different environments contributed to driving genetic differences between the high-level groups," said Catherine Attard, College of Science and Engineering, Flinders University, Australia. He is the first author of the study published in the journal Animal Conservation .Using genomic analysis , the researchers found an "unexpected" similarity between the blue whales of the eastern South Pacific and those of the eastern North Pacific, suggesting they were part of the same subspecies, and not separate as they are currently considered."Unexpected" because the mammals are thought to have opposite when their populations exist on the either side of the equator, they said.Further, despite low genetic diversity between the eastern Indian and western Pacific populations, the researchers identified the eastern Indian Ocean, western South Pacific Ocean and potentially western Indian Ocean as "different" populations within the Indo-western Pacific.The team found no evidence of inbreeding, and described it as "good news" for the potential recovery of subspecies and populations. Challenges still, however, remain, they said.The recovery of baleen whales -- of which the endangered blue whales is a type --is now threatened by multiple human sources, the team explained.These sources included underwater noise, changing availability of food driven by human-induced effects on ocean productivity, environmental contaminants, ship collision and entanglement in fishing gear, they said.While blue whales became protected from commercial whaling in 1966, the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) implemented a global moratorium 20 years later."Our findings build on decades of work to improve the management of endangered blue whales under the International Whaling Commission," said Attard.The researchers called on the IWC to use their findings to refine their classification of blue whales for conservation and management purposes.Along with generating the largest global genomic dataset to date for blue whales, the researchers linked the genetic results to blue whale calls and typical migratory and breeding patterns, using satellite tagging and acoustics.Genomics is vital to and unparalleled in power in determining population differences, connections and other characteristics important to informing biodiversity conservation, said another study co-author Luciano Beheregaray from Flinders University.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108732989,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1436254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Forest fires are becoming increasingly catastrophic across the world, accelerated by climate change, it was noted."A swarm of drones could be the solution," says Suresh Sundaram, professor in the department of aerospace engineering, IISc.Although they have not yet been used in India, the use of drones is not entirely new, according to a press release issued by the Bengaluru-based IISc.But in a new study, Sundaram's team proposes taking the technology a step further: Coordinated multi-swarm drones swooping in to quell forest fires."By the time somebody identifies and reports a fire, it has already started spreading and cannot be put out with one drone," says Sundaram. "You need to have a swarm of drones. A swarm that can communicate with each other."The solution was to design a special kind of algorithm that would allow the swarm to communicate with each other as well as make independent decisions. In a hypothetical scenario, when an alarm is raised about a potential fire, the swarms can be sent in, each drone armed with cameras, thermal and infrared sensors, and temperature detectors, to spot the fires.Once the fire is discovered, the drone closest to it becomes the centre of the swarm and attracts others towards it. Interestingly, each drone will also have autonomy to calculate the fire's size and potential spread, and decide how many drones are needed to quench the fire. "These decisions are made by the drones," says Sundaram."They figure out which cluster of fire is going to spread faster, and allocate the required number of drones to put out that fire while the others look for other fire clusters." The swarm-based search algorithm developed by the team is key to controlling the drones' behaviour, the release said.Searching for fire cannot be random as the area to explore would be too large. To address this, the researchers took inspiration from the foraging behaviour of a marine predator, a flagellum called Oxyrrhis marina. "When foraging, it firsts take longer steps to explore the area. Once it feels like it is closer to the food source, it will reduce the step length and then start exploring the area in more detail," explains Josy John, PhD student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, and lead author of the study published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems.The team decided to incorporate this behaviour into their algorithm."The temperature sensors in the drones look for a minimum (threshold) value. When that is reached, the drones reduce their search step, because the fire is near," John adds.The advantage of using drones, Sundaram points out, is that the decision-making is decentralised, based on data, and aimed at maximum efficiency. No more than the required number of drones will be assigned to a fire cluster, allowing others to fan out in search of other clusters.The researchers have tested specific components of the approach, such as the AI-enabled fire detection using thermal cameras, and accurate payload drop mechanism for fire extinguisher deployment. Full-scale search and mitigation by the swarm is yet to undergo field-testing. Going forward, they plan to combine such drone swarms with unmanned ground vehicles that can carry resources and serve as refuelling stations, the release said.Such drone swarms can also be helpful during other natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, to locate survivors, deliver water, food and medicines; and boost communication, it was noted.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108724966,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1509794,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-you-can-gain-by-planting-trees-under-green-credit-plan/articleshow/108724869.cms|How you can gain by planting trees under Green Credit plan|Centre is offering incentives for individuals, firms to contribute towards environmental goals; first up is a scheme for afforestation of degraded plots. What is GCP And How Is Green Credit Generated? Who Can Take Part? How Will Tree Plantation Happen? Who Will Carry Out Planting Of Trees? When Is Credit Generated? How To Use Credits? What Are The Other Green Practices To Be Covered Under GCP? If the environment is the gainer when more trees are planted there is an incentive for individuals and various entities and businesses, too, for greening barren patches of land in India. The Green Credit Programme ( GCP ) launched by the Centre in October last year provides tradable credits for afforestation efforts.GCP entails an innovative market-based mechanism for incentivising voluntary environment-positive actions. To begin with, the Union environment ministry has notified the methodology for calculating green credits for tree plantation . One Green Credit will be awarded per tree planted on identified land parcels, subject to a minimum density of 1,100 trees per hectare based on local climatic and soil conditions. Credits will be granted after the state/UT forest department issues a certificate regarding the completion of tree plantation. These credits will be made available for trading on a domestic market platform.Individuals, businesses and other entities, including cooperative societies and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), can participate in GCP. The list of participants will eventually be quite broad-based to encourage voluntary adoption of environment-friendly practices.The forest department of every state and UT will identify degraded land parcels, including open forest, scrubland, wasteland etc. under their administrative control and make these available for tree plantation. The land parcels for plantation must be free of all encumbrances and have a mini- mum size of five hectares.Any person or entity looking to undertake tree plantation under the Green Credit scheme can apply to an administrator. The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) has been designated as the administrator in respect of tree plantation.After receiving the application and detailed proposal for tree plantation under GCP, the administrator will issue a demand note to the applicant with the bill for tree plantation and administrative expenses, if any, which have to be paid within a specified pe riod. Once the payment is made, the administrator will direct the forest department to complete the planting of trees within a period of two years from the date of payment.After the planting of trees is completed, the forest department will submit a report to the administrator and issue a certificate of completion to the applicant. The administrator will evaluate and verify the work done and award Green Credits to the applicant based on the total number of trees planted on the assigned land parcel.Credits can be traded on a designated ‘trading platform’ to be maintained by the administrator. There will be a ‘green credit registry’, or an electronic database for the registration and issuance of Green Credits.Alternatively, Green Credits may be exchanged for meeting compliance targets for compensatory afforestation in the case of diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes by businesses. The generated credits can also be used under environmental, social and governance (ESG) leadership indicators or under corporate social responsibility (CSR).Apart from tree plantation, initiatives for water management (conservation, water harvesting, water-use efficiency and reuse of wastewater), waste management (promoting circularity), sustainable agriculture, air pollution reduction, mangrove conservation and restoration, and sustainable building will be incentivised under GCP. The ministry will eventually come out with methodologies for calculating Green Credits for these activities as well.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108724877,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1618538,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It’s on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.Metals — including copper, gold and iron — made up half of the 62 million tons, worth a total of some $91 billion, the report said. Plastics accounted for 17 million tons and the remaining 14 million tons include substances like composite materials and glass.The UN says 22% of the e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022. It is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade because of “staggering growth" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, growing “electronification” of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure, the agencies said.They said some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well asrare Earth metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers. Currently, only 1% of the demand for the 17 minerals that make up the rare metals is met through recycling.About half of all e-waste is generated in Asia, where few countries have laws on e-waste or collection targets, according to the report. Recycling and collection rates top 40% in Europe, where per-capita waste generation is highest: nearly 18 kilograms (39 pounds).In Africa, which generates the least of any of the five big global regions, recycling and collection rates hover at about 1%, it said.“The latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow,” said Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, head of the ITU telecommunication development bureau. “With less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling.”For some, e-waste represents a way to earn cash by rummaging through trash in the developing world to find coveted commodities, despite the health risks.At the Dandora dumpsite where garbage collected from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi ends up — even though a court declared it full over a generation ago — scavengers try to earn a living by picking through rubbish for e-waste that can be sold to businesses as recycled material.Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.“When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health," he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he “can’t come to work because of chest problems.”However, Okoth said they don't have any other options: "We are now used to the smoke because if you don’t go to work you will not eat.”Recycling plants, like Nairobi’s WEEE center, have collection points across Kenya, where people can safely get rid of old electric equipment.“We take inventory of the items," said Catherine Wasolia, WEEE's chief operating officer, to check for data on submitted devices and wipe them clean. Then they test each to assess if "it can be reused or repurposed.”E-waste expert George Masila worries about the impact of electronic waste on soil.“When you have all this e-waste — either in the dumpsites or mercilessly deposited anywhere else — it could have major effects on the soil," Masila said. "Every year it rains and water flows and attracts all these elements that are deposited into the environment. You have water getting contaminated.”He said greater recycling and re-use of such materials, "are some of the things we should be considering.”Report authors acknowledged that many people in the developing world pay their bills through harvesting such e-waste, and called for them to be trained and equipped to make such work safer.“We must try to support these people trying to find their niche,” said Ruediger Kuehr, senior manager of the sustainable cycles program at UNITAR.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108655635,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2374168,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Athens zoo welcomes birth of rare pygmy hippo|ATHENS: A rare and endangered pygmy hippopotamus has been born in Athens' Attica Zoological Park for the first time in 10 years, delighting conservationists.A lack of male pygmy hippos in captivity had complicated breeding efforts, so zoo staff were "absolutely thrilled" the baby was a boy, Noi Psaroudaki, the zoo's wildlife veterinarian, told Reuters."This is the first birth in the zoo in 2024, and what a birth!" Psaroudaki said."Every captive birth of pygmy hippos is extremely important. We're very happy to see this baby grow into a healthy adult hippo, and hopefully one day reproduce," she said.Pygmy hippos are native to swamps and rainforests in western Africa. They are listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and it is estimated only about 2,000-2,500 still live in the wild.Weighing 7 kg (15.4 pounds), the male calf - whose name will go to a vote - was born on Feb. 19 and joins his parents Lizzie and Jamal as the only pygmy hippos at the zoo.The hippo, solitary and nocturnal by nature, will remain with its mother for a couple of months until it ventures into the outdoors enclosure.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108643401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1210078,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108461881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-75884,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/microsoft-plans-to-take-on-iphone-and-android-smartphones-with-this-new-device/articleshow/108439136.cms|Microsoft plans to take on iPhone and Android smartphones with this new device|Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying.A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element.The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market.Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded.“By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have.That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108439136,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-90330,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Google has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi.Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users.YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page.Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation.To protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type.The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.To keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Google has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108432040,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-372473,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions.The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices.According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data.However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data.It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above.As mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108392934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15188,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108392259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-10898,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns.According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves.Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award.Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training."As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.”The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target.Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108391384,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32098,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance , the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI , Sam Altman , discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week.Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube.As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTok|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108390931,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-805976,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes . According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.The supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108390839,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1796420,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Check the guidelines here|Policy and Exceptions Regarding Examination Centre Changes READ ALSO: Recent Developments and Procedures for Centre Changes READ ALSO: The Union Public Service Commission has rescheduled the UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination 2024 from May 26 to June 16. With the exam date drawing closer, many candidates are seeking ways to change their examination centres for various reasons.Yet, the important question remains: Does the Commission permit candidates to modify their examination centres? No, the UPSC does not entertain requests for a change of centre or venue as a general rule.However, in exceptional circumstances, the Commission has relaxed this policy to address safety concerns raised by candidates. Last year, amidst the violence in Manipur, many students were granted permission to change their centres. This allowance was only facilitated after students petitioned the High Court, seeking approval to alter their UPSC examination centres.Once again this year, the Zomi Students Federation has taken legal action by filing a petition in the High Court, advocating for the establishment of examination centres in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi districts of Manipur for the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, 2024, as well as the Indian Forest Service (Preliminary) Examination, 2024.In response to this, the UPSC has assured the Delhi High Court that candidates from the hill districts of Manipur who initially chose Imphal as their examination centre will be allowed to change it. Moreover, the state government will facilitate their travel arrangements.The commission has outlined a process where such aspirants can select alternative examination centres in Aizawl, Mizoram; Kohima, Nagaland; Shillong, Meghalaya; Dispur, Assam; Jorhat, Assam; Kolkata, West Bengal; and Delhi. This change can be requested via email between April 8 and 19.The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) stated that due to the expressed inability of the Manipur government to establish examination centres in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi, it is not viable to set up and manage examination venues there for UPSC examinations.The Commission assigns the roll numbers and venues using a computerised random allocation process, devoid of manual interference. The Commission aims to allocate candidates their preferred centres on a first-apply-first-allot basis. Once a centre reaches its capacity, it ceases to be an option for applicants, who must then select from available alternatives. Early application is recommended to secure preferred centers, although the Commission reserves the right to alter center assignments in response to special circumstances.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108978751,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The eagerly awaited Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main 2024 session 2 is set to commence on April 4th. Conducted by the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), this prestigious exam serves as the gateway for aspiring students seeking admission to undergraduate engineering programs across India. Covering a wide array of courses in the field of engineering, JEE Main is the first step towards realizing the academic dreams of countless engineering enthusiasts.The National Testing Agency (NTA) successfully conducted the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) – 2024 Session 1 (January 2024) across 544 centers in 291 cities, including 21 international centers.This session saw a rise in the number of registered candidates compared to the previous year.There were 1,221,624 registered candidates for JEE Main 2024 Session 1, reflecting a significant increase of 27% from the prior year's count of 860,064. However, the exam was conducted in 10 shifts, which is two fewer than in the previous year.The JEE Main 2024 syllabus has seen a reduction in specific topics across Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect to see less of:The overall syllabus for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics has been reduced by 25% to 35% depending on the subject. This aims to streamline the content and potentially reduce the pressure on students.Communication Systems (from Unit – Electronic Devices). A few topics from Experimental Skills.Physical quantities and their measurements in Chemistry, precision, and accuracy, significant figures (from Unit – Unit 1: Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry). States of Matter (from Unit – Unit 2: States of Matter). Thomson and Rutherford's atomic models and their limitations (from Unit – Unit 3: Atomic Structure). Surface Chemistry (from Unit – Unit 4: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure). s-Block Elements (from Unit – Unit 5: Periodic Classification of Elements). General Principles and Processes of Isolation of Metals (from Unit – Unit 6: Metallurgy). Hydrogen (from Unit – Unit 7: The s-Block Elements). Environmental Chemistry (from Unit – Unit 11: Environmental Chemistry). Polymers (from Unit – Unit 14: Biomolecules). Chemistry in Everyday Life (from Unit – Unit 15: Chemistry in Everyday Life)A few topics within Three Dimensional Geometry. The details on removed content in Mathematics are generally less specific compared to Physics and Chemistry.Note: Students are advised to consult the official NTA website for the most accurate information.The weightage for Mathematics has increased slightly from 30% to 35%, while Physics and Chemistry have seen a minor decrease from 25% each to 22.5% each. This emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation in Mathematics.Here's a breakdown of the subjects and some key points to remember:Expect a focus on core topics like Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics. Some chapters, such as Communication Systems and specific topics from Experimental Skills, have been removed.While core areas like Chemical Bonding, Periodic Classification, and Organic Chemistry remain central, chapters like Physical quantities and their measurements, States of Matter (specific details not mentioned), and Environmental Chemistry have been excluded.Although the emphasis on core concepts like Calculus, Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, and Vectors persists, a slight reduction in content within Three Dimensional Geometry is expected.JEE Main 2024 follows a computer-based test (CBT) format with two papers: Paper 1 (B.E./B.Tech.) and Paper 2 (B.Arch./B.Plan.). Here's a breakdown of the key points:This paper assesses knowledge in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. It consists of 90 questions (30 from each subject) carrying a total of 300 marks.

And why not? This ardent student of Zila School Purnea has astonished everyone (made them proud too!) with his stellar performance in the Bihar Board Class 10 Matric exam this year. Well, he secured an astounding 489 out of 500, claiming the prestigious title of state topper with a remarkable 97.80 per cent.However, behind this extraordinary feat lies a tale of determination, humble beginnings, and unwavering resolve.Born into a family of six, with four siblings, Shivankar is the youngest. His father is a teacher in a private school, while his mother is a skilled tailor. Shivankar’s humble background has never been a deterrent though. Instead, his strong determination has propelled him to be where he is today.In a recent YouTube interview with a leading media house, Shivankar opened up about his journey, sharing insights into his study strategy, success mantra, inspiration, and future aspirations.One of the key elements of Shivankar's success was his meticulous planning and unwavering dedication. He had created a date calendar before the Bihar Board exam, revealed the BSEB topper. In this calendar, he would tick off each passing day and count the days to the exam date, marking his progression. That was his motivation for further preparation. He also made sure that he covered the entire syllabus effectively, without skipping anything.When asked about his source of inspiration, Shivankar's eyes lit up and the name that came out was none other than the late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the beloved former President of India and a globally respected scientist. Dr. Kalam's journey from humble beginnings to the highest office in the land resonated deeply with Shivankar. Well, no dream is too lofty, no goal too distant when the will is strong, isn’t it?Talking about his career goals, Shivankar shared that he wants to join the National Defence Academy (NDA) and serve the nation with pride and ardour. His passion for serving the country is palpable, and he is determined to put his best foot forward to achieve this dream of contributing towards India’s defence forces.While the Bihar Board topper believes in giving his 100 per cent in everything he does, his advice for aspiring toppers is simple yet profound: Follow a learning method that suits you, not what others prescribe. Be it the visualization method or the diagram method, one should find what resonates with his or her unique learning style, suggests Shivankar. He also advised Board exam toppers to create their own notes, revise relentlessly, and never lose sight of their goals.In the heart of Bihar, amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday life, Shivankar stands as a beacon of hope, a testament to the power of dreams and the indomitable spirit of the human will.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108975214,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12166,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The following percentages reflect the highest increases in course consumption in India in Q4: LangChain with a 289% increase compared to Q3, ChatGPT with a 93% increase, and payments with a 93% increase.Vinay Pradhan, Country Manager and Senior Director, India and South Asia at Udemy, said, "With more than 14 million Udemy learners in India, there is huge potential and demand for flexible and effective skills development. Growth in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and LangChain suggests that workers are moving from trying to understand what generative AI (gen AI) is to learning how they can apply it to their roles and businesses. As organizations continue to embrace the promise of GenAI and other fast-evolving innovations, it is even more imperative to develop skills more efficiently than ever before.""2023 was a year where trends around GenAI, hybrid work, building inclusive global workplaces, and macroeconomic uncertainty drove the consistent need to upskill across both technological and leadership capabilities," said Greg Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer at Udemy. "Workers today need tech skills as much as they need soft, or power skills. Our Q4 Workplace Learning Index highlights how professionals are responding to, and meeting these demands, with surging interest in skills like chatbot development, listening, and customer service."The Udemy Global Workplace Learning Index uses data from thousands of Udemy Business customers worldwide. Location data is based on the country associated with the company. The skills data compares the consumption of courses in the Udemy Business collection from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023.

I keep telling myself that if it is so bad, then it is only going to get better and it always does. There is only one way-- to go up, and that's what keeps me positive.I start my day with a workout. Actually, I go to the gym first thing in the morning without eating or drinking anything, and I love it. That's how my day starts. I get up in the morning, I just have one cup of herbal tea, and I hit the gym.Rs 350! (laughs) It was not a paycheque, it was a summer job!My actual first job paid me 4,200 rupees a month. That was when I finished my MBA. I joined J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, as a fresh MBA, and in those times, this was quite a good salary, 4,200 rupees a month.

But do not worry! Here is a list of 7 tried-and-true methods that will help you regain your energy and peace of mind by reducing stress like magic. These methods, which range from basic breathing exercises to the therapeutic effects of laughter, are simple to use and have a major impact on stress management .One of the quickest ways to alleviate stress is through deep breathing exercises . By taking slow, deep breaths, you signal to your body to relax, triggering a calming response in your nervous system. Simply find a quiet space, sit or lie down comfortably, and focus on inhaling deeply through your nose, letting your abdomen expand, then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this for a few minutes whenever you feel overwhelmed.They say laughter is the best medicine, and it's certainly true when it comes to reducing stress. Watching a funny movie, spending time with friends who make you laugh, or even engaging in laughter yoga can all help release endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, which can counteract the effects of stress hormones.Don't underestimate the power of human connection in combating stress. Spending quality time with friends and loved ones can provide a sense of belonging and support, helping to buffer against the negative effects of stress. Whether it's a heartfelt conversation or a fun outing, nurturing yoursocial connections can be a powerful antidote to stress.Our inner dialogue plays a significant role in how we perceive and manage stress. By practicing positive self-talk, you can reframe negative thoughts and cultivate a more optimistic outlook. Instead of dwelling on what could go wrong, focus on what you can control and find solutions to challenges. Affirmations and self-compassion exercises can also help boost resilience in the face of stress.Certain herbal teas , such as chamomile, peppermint, and green tea, have been shown to have calming properties that can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Adding these teas into your daily routine can provide a soothing ritual to unwind and de-stress. Simply steep a bag in hot water, sip mindfully, and feel the tension melt away.Aromatherapy is another effective tool for stress relief , and using a diffuser to disperse calming essential oils can create a tranquil atmosphere in your home or workspace. Scents like lavender, bergamot, and eucalyptus have been shown to have stress-reducing effects, helping to promote relaxation and mental clarity.Putting pen to paper can be a therapeutic way to process emotions and reduce stress. Whether it's jotting down your thoughts and feelings, keeping a gratitude journal, or writing out your worries to release them from your mind, journaling can provide a sense of clarity and perspective. Make it a daily habit to spend a few minutes reflecting on your day and expressing yourself through writing.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108936822,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1110537,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

However, incorporating face wash into both morning and nighttime skincare routines can yield optimal results in maintaining healthy, radiant skin.First thing in the morning, using a face wash can help refresh and awaken the skin, removing any impurities or excess oils that may have accumulated overnight.Cleansing the face in the morning not only helps to prepare the skin for the application of skincare products but also creates a clean canvas for makeup application if desired. Additionally, washing the face in the morning can help to remove any residue from nighttime skincare products, allowing the skin to breathe and function optimally throughout the day.On the other hand, using face wash as the last step in the nighttime skincare routine is essential for effectively removing makeup, dirt, and pollutants accumulated throughout the day. Cleansing the face before bedtime helps to unclog pores, prevent breakouts, and promote skin renewal during the overnight hours. Removing makeup and thoroughly cleansing the skin before sleep also allows nighttime skincare products, such as serums and moisturizers, to penetrate more deeply into the skin, maximizing their effectiveness.For individuals with oily or acne-prone skin, washing the face both in the morning and at night may be beneficial in controlling excess oil production and preventing breakouts. However, those with dry or sensitive skin may find that washing the face only once a day, preferably at night, is sufficient to maintain skin cleanliness without stripping away essential moisture.It's important to choose a gentle, pH-balanced face wash suitable for your skin type and concerns. Avoid using harsh or overly drying cleansers, as they can disrupt the skin's natural barrier and lead to irritation or dehydration. Instead, opt for a mild cleanser that effectively removes impurities without causing undue stress to the skin.Incorporating face wash into both morning and nighttime skincare routines can help to keep the skin clean, balanced, and healthy. Washing the face in the morning prepares the skin for the day ahead, while cleansing at night removes makeup and impurities, allowing the skin to rejuvenate overnight. By establishing a consistent skincare regimen that includes face wash at the appropriate times, you can promote a clear, glowing complexion and maintain optimal skin health.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108928833,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33060,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The post received over 32,000 views and hundreds of likes. But why are GI tags so prestigious and desired?Geographical Indications (GIs) are signs used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess distinctive qualities, reputation, or characteristics attributable to that place of origin. These tags serve as intellectual property rights that identify a product’s unique geographical source, providing legal protection and preventing unauthorized use. Their significance cannot be understated. Once a product receives a GI tag, it gains legal protection against unauthorized use by others. The registered proprietors have exclusive rights to use the GI tag for the specified goods or products, preventing misuse, imitation, or misleading representations. Beyond legal protection, GI recognition contributes to rural development by supporting artisans, weavers, and communities involved in producing these unique items. Moreover, GI tags enhance the marketability of Indian products globally, signaling authenticity and uniqueness. These tags aren’t limited to popular products; they exist for hundreds of items across states, each recognizing a specific region and product.Here are some of the traditional items from Assam that have recently received the prestigious Geographical Indication (GI) tags:Assamese Bihu Dhol : The iconic two-faced drum played with a stick and a hand, essential in Assam’s folk entertainment and culture.Assamese Jaapi: A traditional bamboo hat made from tokou paat (palm leaf) and densely woven bamboo or cane. It symbolizes pride in Assam and was historically used for sun and rain protection.Sarthebari Metal Craft: The centuries-old handicraft industry from Barpeta that is known for it's bell-metal products, with around 2000 artisans engaged in this craft.Panimeteka Craft (Water Hyacinth): Crafted from water hyacinth, this product has gained recognition.Mising Taat (Handloom): Handwoven textiles made by the Mising community that play a significant role in Assamese culture.Asharikandi’s Exquisite Terracotta Works: Beautiful terracotta creations from Asharikandi that are intrinsic to Assamese cultural heritageAside from these items, thirteen of the GI-tagged products were specifically linked to the Bodo community, which forms the largest tribal group in Assam.

Here are some strategies to help you boost the productivity of your team:1.Set clear goals and expectationsClearly defined goals provide your team with a much-needed sense of direction and purpose. Setting specific and measurable goals for both individual team members and the team goes a long way in making people remain focused on needle-moving outcomes.2. Lead by exampleYour actions set the tone for the entire team and demonstrating the attributes you expect others to showcase is critical. Show your team that you're willing to get your hands dirty alongside them, solving problems while fostering a culture of dedication and accountability will inspire others to discover their best.3. Clear communication channelsEffective and adequate communication is the cornerstone of productivity. Establish clear channels for communication within your team, ensuring that everyone knows whom to contact for different types of queries or updates. It always helps if your teammates are up to speed with the big picture and find you and the management team approachable and flexible4.

On her wedding to Saif Ali Khan in 2012, Kareena technically wore a 73-year-old wedding ensemble belonging to the Pataudi family. By choosing to wear Sharmila Tagore's royal sharara, Kareena paid homage to the rich legacy of Bollywood and the deep bonds of family tradition. Sharmila Tagore, a revered figure in Indian cinema, had worn the sharara on her wedding day to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, creating an iconic bridal moment that has stood the test of time.

More recently, there's news of his daughter Isha Ambani and her husband Anand Piramal selling off their Los Angeles house to a famous Hollywood celebrity couple . Read on to know more details about it here.It is known that Isha Ambani spent a major part of her pregnancy in her Los Angeles home, along with her mother Nita Ambani .Spread over 38,000 square feet, the property is said to have 12 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, and even a gym, salon, spas, an indoor badminton court and much more. And now, as per reports, news is that this lavish property has been bought by Hollywood celebrity couple Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck . Not just this, buzz is that Jennifer and her husband Ben bought the luxurious house for over 61 million USD which is approximately INR 500 crores.Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck bought the house from Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal in June 2023, as per a report by HT.Meanwhile, it is noted that Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal got married in 2018 and they were gifted a lavish house 'Gulita' in south Mumbai by Anand's parents, Ajay and Dr Swati Piramal. Isha and Anand were blessed with twins-- a son Krishna and a daughter Aadiya-- on November 19, 2022. The twins recently started their playschool, and both Isha and Anand were seen taking them for their first day at school.It is noted that even Nita Ambani had twins Isha and Akash in the USA; but they were born prematurely. In an earlier interview to fashion desginers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, Nita had revealed that it was her husband Mukesh who had chosen the name Isha for their daughter.

February's improvement on that was partly due to base effects.In January, Pakistan's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 22% for the fifth policy-setting meeting in a row and raised its full-year inflation projections.The governor of the State Bank of Pakistan said the rise in its average inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending in June to 23%-25% from a previous projection of 20%-22% was due to increasing gas and electricity prices.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108141282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1526015,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

But Khan soon developed differences with him and began to criticise him. He doubled down on his criticism after the toppling of his govt in April 2022.PTI chief Gohar Khan told media after meeting Khan in the Adiala Jail that the former PM asked him to demand the resignation of Raja. "After meeting Khan sahib today, the PTI demands that the CEC resign. He has no right to stay in the position for a single day," Barrister Gohar Khan said outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder has been jailed. Since CEC failed to perform his duties we demand the CEC to resign immediately so that all probes should be impartial and fair and according to the mandate of the people," he said.He demanded that all the inquiries into poll discrepancies be impartial and without any interference.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107865059,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-608000,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

PTI Sunday demanded a judicial probe into the allegations.Rawalpindi division commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha Saturday alleged he oversaw the rigging to deprive PTI of 13 seats which were given to losing candidates after fake votes were added to their name. Chattha claimed Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa were involved in the alleged rigging.PTI leader Gohar Ali Khan at a press conference said efforts were made to keep the party out of the electoral arena when people, responding to the call Imran made, went to polling stations in huge numbers. "We had won 180 seats in the National Assembly, 42 seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly, 115 in Punjab, 16 in Sindh, and four in Balochistan assembly," he said.Gohar said the allegations by Chattha corroborated what the party had been saying all along. "That is why PTI demands a judicial commission is formed and an inquiry is conducted. And not just an inquiry, but those (involved) should be made to join the inquiry," he said, adding that the report of the inquiry should be shared with the people.He also said that a judicial inquiry should be conducted involving independent judges. "And those named by the Rawalpindi commissioner should not be a part of this inquiry," he said. Gohar also said PTI was not calling for the resignation of chief justice.ECP strongly rejected the allegations made against chief election commissioner. It formed a high-level committee to probe the allegations.Meanwhile, the third meeting between PML-N and PPP Saturday remained inconclusive and both decided to meet again Monday to finalise the power-sharing formula.In the meantime, PPP chairman Bilawal revealed the power-sharing formula that he was offered by PML-N, under which the PM's post would be shared between two parties. "I was told that let us be PM for three years and then you can take the premiership for the remaining two years," he said. "I said no to this... If I become PM, it would be after people of Pakistan elect me."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107802611,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2301044,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Foreign Ministry defended the vote, stating that it was peaceful and successful.The US State Department expressed concern about the elections, citing restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.Similarly, the European Union expressed regret over the lack of a level playing field due to the inability of some political actors to participate in the elections.In response to these statements, the ministry expressed surprise at the negative tone and highlighted the complexity of the electoral process. It emphasized the millions of Pakistanis who exercised their right to vote freely and enthusiastically.The ministry also pointed out that Pakistan successfully held general elections despite serious security threats from foreign-sponsored terrorism. It clarified that there was no nationwide internet shutdown, only a suspension of mobile services to prevent terrorist incidents on polling day.In the election results, no political party secured a simple majority. Independent candidates supported by imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan emerged as frontrunners in the vote count. As a result, Nawaz Sharif, the three-time premier and Khan's main rival, announced plans to form a coalition government. Khan himself was disqualified from running due to criminal convictions.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, led by Imran Khan, secured 100 out of the 266 available seats in the National Assembly. The Pakistan Muslim League party, led by Nawaz Sharif, won 71 seats.Additionally, on Saturday, a clash in North Waziristan resulted in the leader of a political party being wounded and two police officers losing their lives.

He added that some candidates would be filing appeals with the appellate tribunals through private lawyers, while others would be offered party's help."The candidates have collected the certified copies of 'rejection decisions' from respective ROs on Sunday and will begin filing appeals with the appellate tribunals from today," he told Dawn.Earlier on December 30, the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected scores of nomination forms from the PTI across the country -- a move that the former ruling party decided to challenge at relevant forums.Separately, Barrister Gohar Khan and Barrister Umair Khan Niazi will meet the party's founder, Imran Khan, in Adiala Jail on Monday to get his approval for the selection of party candidates and the consequent award of tickets.According to the Central Punjab nomination papers data, 281 candidates submitted their papers for 44 NA constituencies out of which 95 nomination papers were rejected, while 186 candidates' nomination papers were accepted.The PTI leaders alleged that the ROs appointed from the civil bureaucracy did not exercise their powers and decision-making and instead waited for orders coming from "quarters concerned".Citing a glaring example, the PTI leaders said that RO for NA-132 (Kasur-II) issued and displayed the "list of validly nominated candidates" that included PTI candidate Muhammad Saleem among a total of 19 candidates.However, the RO later issued a revised list of valid candidates, which reflected only 18 candidates minus Muhammad Saleem, Dawn reported.Notably, PTI candidate Sardar Azeemullah Khan had earlier reported that his nomination papers were scrutinised and found to be accurate, but the RO said he would issue a certificate only after receiving a confidential report from Islamabad.Separately, the PTI also launched a 'WhatsApp' account to seek video and pictorial evidence regarding the "pre-poll rigging" in the run-up to elections, Dawn reported."If you see or observe any pre-polling rigging in any constituency, please send details with pictures and videos to PTI SMT at the given number," a message shared on PTI's social media read.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106431912,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-492538,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld the Centre government's decision of August 2019 to abrogate Article 370, which bestowed a special status on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.Khan, who has been incarcerated in the Adiala jail of Rawalpindi, in a message said that the Indian top court's ruling was a sheer violation of the UNSC resolutions, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party said in a post on X.Khan "made it clear that the controversial and unlawful decision of the Indian top court would further complicate the Kashmir issue instead of helping to solve the decades-long conflict," it added.He vowed that his party would continue to provide full diplomatic, moral and political support to the Kashmiri people.Khan, addressed by his party as "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman-for-life", recalled that the Kashmir issue was the main bone of contention between Pakistan and India.He emphasised that the then PTI government led by him had strongly reacted when India tried to alter the special status of Kashmir in 2019, referring to the downgrading of bilateral diplomatic ties.Khan added that he wanted to establish good ties with India while putting national interests first. However, after August 5, 2019, it was not possible because "we did not want to compromise on the aspirations" of the Kashmiri people, he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105952734,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-608000,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the Mir Ali area of the North Waziristan District when they exchanged fire with militants, the military said. One soldier also died and troops recovered weapons and ammunition from the militants' hideout.North Waziristan had served for decades as a safe haven for militants until the military carried out a major operation after an attack on an army-run school in Peshawar in 2014 killed more than 150 people, mostly schoolchildren.After the yearslong operation, the army announced it had cleared the region of local and foreign militants. Occasional attacks have continued, however, raising concerns that the local Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, found sanctuaries in Afghanistan and are regrouping in the area.The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group but allies of the Afghan Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 as the US and Nato troops were in the final stages of their pullout after 20 years of war.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104442910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116486,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Khan is serving a three-year sentence after being convicted in the Toshakhana corruption case .The Punjab Prisons Department's (PPD) spokesperson said all facilities available under 257 and 771 of the Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 have been made available to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief, Geo News reported.The clarification by the spokesperson comes after Additional District and Sessions Judge, Attock, Shafquat Ullah Khan visited 70-year-old Khan's cell in the Attock jail and found his complaints and concerns regarding living conditions including the lack of privacy in the washroom to be "genuine".The judge in his observations on Monday said Khan on his visit had expressed "grave concerns" about the violation of his privacy and the prevailing living conditions within the prison.Addressing the concerns that Khan did not have any privacy in the bathroom, the spokesperson said a new washroom was constructed in the PTI chairman's cell."The walls of the washroom are kept five feet high and a door is also installed," he said, adding that a western commode and wash basin have also been installed.The cricketer-turned-politician, who has a massive following across Pakistan, is currently serving a three-year sentence in Attock Jail after being found guilty of corrupt practices in the Toshakhana case earlier this month.Khan during his meeting with the judge raised significant concerns regarding a CCTV camera positioned in front of his prison bars, located at a distance of five to six feet, which covers an open bathroom-cum-latrine.Regarding the CCTV cameras, the spokesperson said that they were installed outside the room."CCTV cameras have been installed outside Imran Khan's room for his and jail security. More than 4,000 CCTV cameras have been installed not only in district jail Attock but also in other jails of Punjab for security purposes," the statement added.He further stated that amenities such as bath soap, perfume, air freshener, towels, and tissue papers had been provided, along with a bed, pillows, mattresses, tables, chairs, air conditioners, and exhaust fans.Moreover, he added that five doctors had been appointed for Khan, of whom one was available at all times, and the PTI chief was only given "special" food after it was checked by doctors."Fruits, honey, dates, prayer mat, Quran and books have also been given," the spokesperson added.It was also reported Khan complained that his wife and lawyers had no easy access to him; however, the spokesperson said the PTI chairman's family meets him on Tuesdays, while his lawyers visit him on Thursdays.Khan's wife Bushra Bibi last week voiced concerns about the possibility of her husband being "poisoned" during incarceration at the Attock jail.In a letter dated August 17 addressed to the Punjab home secretary, Khan's wife had sought the ex-premier be transferred from district jail in Attock to Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, expressing fear that he could be poisoned in lock-up.According to the letter, the life of the ex-prime minister was in danger as "he was previously attacked twice whereby once he was hit by bullets shots (sic) on his body".In a related development, the PTI Core Committee meeting highlighted the observations of Additional District and Sessions Judge Shafqut Ullah Khan who "verified the bad treatment being meted out to him (Khan) in Attock Jail".The PTI said the judge's report subscribed to their assertions that the PTI chairman was being subjected to inhuman and illegal treatment in the Attock prison.Meanwhile, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said the PTI chief was allowed to meet visitors and provided facilities according to the prison class he applied for.Bugti said he would definitely enquire from the Punjab government and jail officials about other issues raised in the inspection report such as the CCTV camera."We will ensure that all those facilities and the prison class he (Imran) applied for and deserves as the ex-prime minister according to the law are provided to him. As far as I know, he has a bed and is provided with newspapers but he would get only the facilities that the relevant laws permit."Khan is on Tuesday scheduled to appear before the Islamabad High Court for the hearing of his plea against his conviction and sentence in the Toshakhana corruption case, a verdict that could be crucial for his political future as well for his party ahead of the general elections.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102961336,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17816,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The removal of those restrictions beginning in June was a condition of a $3 billion International Monetary Fund loan programme to help the crisis-ridden economy.Traders said the rupee fell 0.6% to an intraday low of 299 against the dollar. On May 11, it logged a record closing low of 298.93. That was two days after former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested on allegations of land graft, plunging the country further into political turmoil.Pakistan is currently being governed by a caretaker government that is tasked with steering the country through to a national election that should, in theory, take place by November, while grappling with searing political tension as well as historically high inflation and interest rates.Tahir Abbas , head of research at Arif Habib, a Karachi-based brokerage company, said he expected the rupee to trade between 295 and 305 to the dollar for the time being."The declining trend is mainly attributable to the ease off in the import restrictions coupled with clearance of backlog for goods and services," he said.He added that multinational corporations were able to repatriate some profits, furthering rupee outflows.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102939932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-681847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The number soared to 315,600 in 2019, up 15.1% from a year earlier, official data showed.Bhutan has always been wary of the impact of mass tourism and it bans mountain climbing to preserve the sanctity of its peaks. The tourist fee has limited arrivals to bigger spenders who make up a fraction of the numbers that visit nearby Nepal.Nevertheless, Bhutan hopes to raise the contribution of tourism to its $3 billion economy 20%, from about 5%.Dorji Dhradhul, director general of the Department of Tourism , said the halving of the fee could boost arrivals in the September-December peak tourist period, which includes many religious and cultural events in the mainly Buddhist country.In June, the government eased rules on length of stay and fees for tourists but numbers have not picked up as expected.Dhradhul said more than 56,000 tourists had visited Bhutan since January but about 42,000 were Indian nationals, who only have to pay a fee of 1,200 Indian rupees ($14.5) a day.About 50,000 Bhutanese are employed in tourism which earned about $84 million a year in the three years before the pandemic in foreign exchange.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103084822,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1675979,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The remarks by Jaishankar came on Wednesday as he updated through a video message members of the India-Sri Lanka Parliamentary Friendship Association on bilateral relations.He also reiterated India's support for the preservation of Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and multi-religious identity.Jaishankar expressed hope for a reconciliation process that addresses the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice and self-respect within the framework of a united and prosperous Sri Lanka. He highlighted a meaningful devolution of powers according to the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Constitution and early conduct of Provincial Council elections as being facilitative towards this objective, according to an official statement by the Indian High Commission in Colombo.The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987.Jaishankar also delved into India's positive contributions to Sri Lanka's development, stability, and prosperity based on geographical proximity and shared democratic values between the two countries."He highlighted the swift and substantial response by India to the economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka over the past year, exemplifying India's commitment to the 'Neighbourhood First' policy. EAM emphasised that the financial assistance of approximately USD 4 billion extended by India was unprecedented in both magnitude and swiftness, surpassing the response of international institutions and bilateral partners," the statement said.The economic crisis in Sri Lanka triggered by forex shortages forced the public into the streets which led to the ouster of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Jaishankar elaborated on India's vision of fostering long-term and sustainable solutions, mentioning collaborative efforts to address Sri Lanka's energy requirements through grid connectivity and a Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) pipeline. He highlighted the potential of renewable energy and regional economic activities, including the Trincomalee hub, for mutual benefit.On regional security, Jaishankar reiterated India's "Security and Growth for All in the Region" (SAGAR) outlook and its expression through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), the statement said.The address by Jaishankar served as a "reminder of the enduring friendship between India and Sri Lanka and reinvigorated the commitment to strengthen ties for the mutual benefit of both nations and the broader region," the high commission said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103037464,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-10964,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Corrections officials previously had said Thaksin, 74, was considered vulnerable due to his age and chronic conditions of his heart and lungs, high blood pressure, and back problems.Hours after Thaksin's return to Thailand, Pheu Thai party candidate Srettha Thavisin secured enough votes to become prime minister, ending over three months of suspense, legal wrangling and horse trading that followed May elections. The party had entered a coalition with military parties linked to a coup that removed it from power in 2014, and excluded the progressive Move Forward Party that won the most votes in the elections.Srettha is expected to receive a royal endorsement as prime minister later Wednesday, according to Thai media.Pheu Thai is the latest in a string of parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. The coup that ousted him triggered nearly two decades of deep political divisions that pitted a mostly poor, rural majority in the north that supports Thaksin against royalists, the military and their urban backers.A Pheu Thai government led by Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra , was ousted in the 2014 coup by then-army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who is now the outgoing prime minister.It is widely speculated Thaksin returned out of hope that a friendly government will reduce his sentence, although he has said his decision had nothing to do with the Pheu Thai party's bid for power and that he was ready to follow the legal process. The outgoing government has said Thaksin can request a royal pardon like any other inmate.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102966002,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-897483,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

New FAA rules allow it, but planes largely avoid it|DUBAI: Two years after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan , the United States has begun easing rules that could allow commercial airlines to fly over the country in routes that cut time and fuel consumption for East-West travel.But those shortened flight routes for India and Southeast Asia raise questions never answered during the Taliban's previous rule from the 1990s to the months after the Sept.11, 2001, attacks.How, if at all, do you deal with the Taliban as they block women from schools and jobs, and engage in behavior described by United Nations experts as potentially akin to "gender apartheid?" Can airlines manage the risk of flying in uncontrolled airspace over a country where an estimated 4,500 shoulder-launched anti-aircraft weapons still lurk? And what happens if you have an emergency and need to land suddenly?Who wants to fly over such a country? The OPSGroup, an organization for the aviation industry, recently offered a simple answer: "No one!""There's no ATC service across the entire country, there's a seemingly endless list of surface-to-air weaponry they might start shooting at you if you fly too low, and if you have to divert then good luck with the Taliban," the group wrote in an advisory, using an acronym for air traffic control.Still, the possibility of overflights resuming would have a major impact on carriers.Though landlocked, Afghanistan's position inCentral Asia means it sits along the most direct routes for those traveling from India to Europe and America. After the Taliban takeover of Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021, civil aviation simply stopped, as ground controllers no longer managed the airspace. Fears about anti-aircraft fire, particularly after the 2014 shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, saw authorities around the world order their commercial airliners out.In the time since, airlines largely curve around Afghanistan's borders. Some travel south over Iran and Pakistan. Other flights rush through Afghan airspace for only a few minutes while over the sparsely populated Wakhan Corridor , a narrow panhandle that juts out of the east of the country between Tajikistan and Pakistan , before continuing on their way.But those diversions add more time to flights - which mean the aircraft burns more jet fuel, a major expense for any carrier. That's why a decision in late July by the US Federal Aviation Administration caught the industry's eye when it announced flights above 32,000 feet (9,750 meters) "may resume due to diminished risks to US civil aviation operations at those altitudes."The FAA , which oversees rules for America-based airlines, referred questions about what fueled the decision to the State Department. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment. However, a State Department envoy has met multiple times with Taliban officials since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan.Taliban officials likewise did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press over the lifting of the restrictions.For now, outside of Afghan and Iranian carriers, it does not appear that any airline is taking chances over the country. Part of that comes from the risk of militant fire, as Afghanistan has been awash in aircraft-targeting missiles since the CIA armed mujahedeen fighters to fight the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Afghanistan also may still have Soviet-era KS-19 anti-aircraft guns, said Dylan Lee Lehrke, an analyst at the open-source intelligence firm Janes.The FAA says it believes flights at or above 32,000 feet remain out of reach of those weapons, even if fired from a mountain top.United Airlines runs a direct flight to New Delhi from Newark, New Jersey, that uses the Wakhan Corridor and could be shortened by an overflight."In accordance with current FAA rules, United operates Newark to New Delhi flights over a small section of Afghanistan where air traffic control is provided by other countries," United spokesman Josh Freed told the AP." We do not plan to expand our use of Afghan airspace at this time."Virgin Atlantic flies over the corridor for its New Delhi flights as well. The United Kingdom has yet to change its guidance telling carriers to stay out of nearly all of Afghan airspace. Virgin Atlantic said it makes "ongoing dynamic assessments of flight routings based on the latest situation reports and always following the strict advice set out by the U.K."American Airlines and Air India also use the Wakhan Corridor route. Those carriers did not respond to requests for comment.Despite the lack of interest now, airlines in the past used the route heavily. A November 2014 report from the International Civil Aviation Organization noted that from near-zero flights in 2002, overflights grew to over 100,000 annually some 12 years later. Before the Taliban takeover, the government charged each flight $700 in fees for flying over the country - which could be a significant sum of cash as Afghanistan remains mired in an economic crisis.And there is precedence for collecting overflight fees and holding them. After the 2001 US-led invasion, authorities ended up releasing some $20 million in frozen overflight fees to Afghanistan's fledging government.In the Taliban's telling, however, they already are profiting from the limited overflights they see. Private Afghan television broadcaster Tolo quoted Imamuddin Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Transportation and Aviation Authority Ministry, as saying that Afghanistan had earned more than $8.4 million from overflight fees in the last four months."Any flight which is crossing Afghan airspace should pay $700," Ahmadi said. "As the flights increase, it benefits Afghanistan."The ministry also said it received the money from the International Air Transport Association, a trade association of the world's airlines. However, IATA told the AP in a statement that its contract with Afghanistan to collect overflight fees "has been suspended since September 2021" to comply with international sanctions on the Taliban."No payments have been made since that date," it said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102809466,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal," she said. "I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment."When asked about the criticism, Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf said the bill was about "protecting people from a rising tide of hatred". "It is not Twitter police. It is not activists, it is not the media. It is not, thank goodness, even politicians who decide ultimately whether or not crime has been committed," Yousaf said. He said it would be up to "the police to investigate, and the threshold for criminality is incredibly high." "Unless your behaviour is threatening and intends to stir up hatred, then you have nothing to worry."Police Scotland said it had received complaints in relation to Rowling's post. "(But) The comments are not assessed to be criminal and no further action will be taken," it said.Earlier, PM Rishi Sunak said Britain had a proud tradition of free speech and that the new law had given the police the wrong priorities. "We should not be criminalising people saying common sense things about biological sex," he told reporters. "Clearly that isn't right."India Willoughby, Britain's first transgender newsreader and one of those who was listed by Rowling, questioned why anyone should "publicly denigrate and mock" trans people. "The best-known author in the world sitting up all night to write a mega-long troll post about me, because she's consumed by a hatred of trans people."Scotland has been at the forefront of extending rights to the transgender community but a previous bid to make it easier to change a legal gender was blocked by London over concerns it would impinge existing equality legislation.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108984493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1382013,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The British Indian leader made a statement about the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, which came in force on Monday and led Rowling to issue a sharp rebuke on social media warning against the "dangers of eliminating women's and girls' single-sex spaces".The law creates a new crime of "stirring up hatred" relating to protected characteristics."People should not be criminalised for stating simple facts on biology. We believe in free speech in this country, and Conservatives will always protect it," Sunak said in a statement.In a series of social media posts on Monday, Rowling - a vocal defender of women's only spaces when being balanced with the rights of transexuals - referenced several transgender women as men, including convicted prisoners, trans activists and other public figures. The award-winning Scottish author, who lives in Edinburgh, then invited police to arrest her if they believed she had committed an offence under the new law."I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment," writes Rowling on X, formerly Twitter.Rowling, 58, said the members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who voted for the new hate crime laws had "placed higher value on the feelings of men performing their idea of femaleness, however misogynistically or opportunistically, than on the rights and freedoms of actual women and girls".Humza Yousaf, the Pakistani-origin First Minister of Scotland who was justice minister in the Scottish National Party (SNP) led government when the bill was passed in the Scottish Parliament Holyrood in 2021, was targeted with Islamophobic graffiti near his home in Dundee in the wake of the new law being enforced. However, he insisted it was a reminder of why such a law is needed to ensure a "zero-tolerance approach to hatred".Police Scotland is investigating the graffiti and said "inquiries are ongoing".Meanwhile, hundreds gathered outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to protest against the new hate crime law for its restrictions on freedom of speech. They waved placards reading: "Truth is not hate speech" and "Protect free speech".The new laws were developed following an Independent Review of Hate Crime Legislation, which concluded that new specific offences relating to stirring up hatred were needed.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108980781,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-956627,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In the video message dated March 22, Kate Middleton disclosed her cancer diagnosis and mentioned she is undergoing 'preventative chemotherapy.'The release timing was influenced not by her absence from Easter church services but because of a leak about her health condition.An insider indicated that the Palace was compelled to act swiftly to stay ahead of the narrative. The source of the leak, whether from The London Clinic where she had surgery in January or another source, remains uncertain, a Daily Mail report said.In a heartfelt video, the Princess, aged 42, shared the 'huge shock' of her cancer diagnosis following abdominal surgery and the challenging times her family has faced. While the specific type of cancer was not disclosed, she started 'preventative chemotherapy' in late February. Describing herself as 'well and getting stronger every day,' she maintains a positive outlook toward recovery. Prince William and Kate have taken careful steps to inform their children about her health condition sensitively. The King, also battling cancer since February, has expressed pride in the Princess's courage for publicly discussing her treatment. Queen Camilla recently highlighted the public's supportive response towards the Princess.Prince William is scheduled to resume his public responsibilities once his children go back to school after the Easter holidays.In the meantime, he remains committed to supporting his wife and family while upholding his royal obligations, a balance he has managed since her surgery in January, the Daily Mail report said.The royal family's recent health challenges have prompted adjustments in their public roles and appearances, with Prince William balancing support for his wife with his royal duties. It's unclear how long Kate's treatment will continue, but she hopes to participate in events as her health permits. This situation underscores the royal family's resilience and the community's overwhelming support during difficult times.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108968564,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1009971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The proposals, which had been unveiled by former Indian-origin home secretary Suella Braverman, would mean rough sleepers in England and Wales could be fined as much as 2,500 or face prison terms."A lot of colleagues believe that the bill as it stands is completely unacceptable because it would have the effect of criminalising people who have no choice but to sleep on the streets," said Tory MP Bob Blackman, who is also joint secretary of the powerful Conservative backbench 1922 committee.The bill is designed to present Conservatives as tough on crime as it prepares for a gruelling election campaign, with the odds stacked against it due to anti-incumbency sentiments.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108953931,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36722,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

What Americans say|NEW DELHI: A majority of Americans do not believe Prince Harry should be deported if found to have misrepresented his drug use on his US visa application . Amidst speculations and legal actions seeking access to his records, sources affirm that Prince Harry answered truthfully when applying for his US visa in 2020. This legal scrutiny comes after his candid revelations in his autobiography "Spare," where he admits to past drug use, including cocaine, cannabis, and psychedelic mushrooms, a Daily Mail report said.A Dailymail.com exclusive pol indicates that 44% of Americans feel Prince Harry should be allowed to remain in the US, even if inaccuracies in his visa application were later discovered, while 33% support his deportation under those circumstances.Political lines show differences in opinion, with Republicans more inclined towards deportation than Democrats and Independents, who largely support his stay.A plurality of Republicans, at 42%, believe Harry should be deported if it's found he misrepresented his drug use on the form, compared to 35% who do not. Conversely, a majority of Democrats, 56% to 24%, and Independents, 40% to 32%, are in favor of allowing him to remain in the U.S. regardless of his answers on the form.The poll also highlighted differences in opinion among ethnic groups: 41% of Hispanic Americans advocate for his deportation if he lied, against 37% who do not. On the other hand, both white and black Americans predominantly support his stay in the U.S., irrespective of his responses on the visa application form.This discussion gains complexity with former President Donald Trump hinting at possible deportation for the Duke of Sussex, citing no "special privileges" should the allegations of lying about drug use be confirmed. Conversely, the Biden administration, through Ambassador Jane Hartley, suggests that Prince Harry's stay in the US is secure under the current presidency.The Heritage Foundation, a Washington, DC-based think tank, is actively pursuing the release of Prince Harry's immigration records, arguing that his public admissions in "Spare" negate any right to privacy regarding his visa application's veracity. This case highlights ongoing debates about privacy, celebrity status, and immigration ethics in the US, the report said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108936344,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-747653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

His presence aimed to restore a sense of normalcy to the royal family, which has faced multiple health crises recently, including Princess Catherine's cancer diagnosis.Princess Catherine, also known as Kate, did not accompany the family to the service, as planned. Her absence follows her recent announcement of a cancer diagnosis, discovered during post-operative tests after abdominal surgery earlier this year.While Charles has maintained a visible presence, engaging with dignitaries and religious leaders, he has avoided larger gatherings on medical grounds. Notably, he delegated the traditional Maundy Thursday service duties to Queen Camilla, emphasizing his cautious approach amidst his health battle.In a recorded message for the service, Charles expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support, acknowledging the importance of friendship during challenging times.Despite rumors circulating on social media, including false reports of his death, Buckingham Palace has not disclosed details about Charles's cancer type, prognosis, or treatment, fueling speculation and prompting diplomatic interventions to quash misinformation.As the king navigates his health journey, his public appearance underscores his determination to continue serving his duties while facing a formidable health challenge, supported by Queen Camilla and the outpouring of well-wishes from around the world.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108931855,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-720481,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"You're very brave to stand out here in the cold," Charles told them."Keep going strong," one member of the crowd shouted as Charles and Queen Camilla walked by.The 75-year-old monarch's presence was viewed as an attempt to reassure the public. Charles had scaled back his public engagements in early February after Buckingham Palace disclosed that he was undergoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.While the king has persisted in carrying out his state obligations, including reviewing government documents and holding meetings with the prime minister, his participation in a customary royal occasion like the Easter service is interpreted as an indication of his gradual reintroduction to public life. British media outlets indicated last week that Charles would gradually expand his public engagements following Easter.The Easter service was notably smaller than usual, as Princess Kate, who is undergoing cancer treatment, has temporarily suspended her public duties. Neither she, her husband Prince William, nor their children attended the service.Kate Middleton's surprising revelation about her cancer diagnosis was announced on March 22, following weeks of speculation regarding her health and whereabouts subsequent to undergoing significant abdominal surgery in February.Charles' mandated withdrawal from public engagements has been a setback for a man keen on shaping the monarchy, having waited nearly 74 years — longer than any previous heir — to ascend to the throne.Upon his succession following Queen Elizabeth II, Charles confronted the formidable challenge of showcasing the relevance of the 1,000-year-old monarchy in a modern nation with citizens from diverse corners of the globe. With less than two years on the throne, the king is in the process of defining his public persona as he endeavors to convince young individuals and members of minority communities that the royal family can be inclusive and representative of them.While the responsibilities of a constitutional monarch are primarily ceremonial, the role of royalty can be draining. Apart from occasional processions in full regalia, there are numerous meetings with political figures, dedication ceremonies, and events celebrating the achievements of British citizens. In Charles's first year as king, these engagements amounted to a total of 161 days.The palace made concerted efforts to maintain the king's visibility in the public sphere, even as he aimed to minimize contacts to lower his risk of infection during treatment. Videos showing the king reading get-well cards and meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were publicly released. Additionally, he participated in a session of the Privy Council, a gathering of senior advisors.Although he did not attend a pre-Easter service on Thursday, Charles issued a pre recorded audio message expressing his remorse for missing a tradition typically attended by the monarch.Additionally, he reiterated his commitment, made during his coronation, that "not to be served, but to serve.""That I have always tried to do and continue to do, with my whole heart," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108919842,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-982638,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Speculations & Conspiracy Theories Surface as Princess of Wales Goes MIA NEW DELHI: A week back, 42-year-old Princess of Wales took the world by surprise when she addressed the public in a video message, revealing her ongoing cancer treatment after undergoing abdominal surgery in January. When Princess Kate appeared solo in a video message, it was widely wondered why Prince William didn't join her.Despite referencing Prince William and their children — Prince George (10), Princess Charlotte (8), and Prince Louis (5) — multiple times in the video, the royal felt it was crucial to deliver the message solo and at the right moment.The children were already on Easter holiday from school when the palace released Kate's pre-recorded video revealing her diagnosis. This decision was made to allow the family to have private time together in the upcoming weeks.Explained why Prince William had not appeared in Kate’s emotional video, People quoted a palace source as saying, “It is a message from the princess about her health, and she wanted to personally deliver the message on her own.”"William is extremely proud of his wife for the courage and strength she has shown not just this week but since her surgery in January, " the source said. "Now more than ever, he’s focused on ensuring his wife has the privacy she needs to fully recover and that his children are shielded from the understandable interest in the news that has been shared."Kate had stated in her message that she was informed by her doctors that cancer had been detected in her body and that she is 'now in the early stages of that treatment.'According to Kensington Palace, the future queen is presently undergoing chemotherapy , which began in February. Kate underwent 'major abdominal surgery' on January 16 and the procedure was successful, according to the hospital record.Since no testing had shown that cancer was present, it was believed at the time of her surgery that her condition was not malignant. Post-operative testing did, however, confirm the presence of malignancy.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108900253,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1009966,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The incident occurred on Friday in Wimbledon, southwest London , sparking fears that the journalist was targeted due to his profession.The victim, identified by Britain's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) as prominent British-based Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati , hosts a show on Iran International, a Persian language television news network critical of Iran's government.Zeraati, in his 30s, sustained a leg injury during the attack but is in stable condition and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, condemned the attack as "cowardly" and expressed solidarity with Zeraati, his family, and colleagues. This incident follows Britain's sanctions in January against Iranian officials, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Unit 840, for their involvement in threats to kill journalists in the UK.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Counter Terrorism Command, said that while the motive remains unclear, the victim's occupation and previous threats to Iran International employees are significant factors in the investigation. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the attack's reason, British police and security officials have highlighted Iran's increasing use of criminal proxies for attacks abroad, including direct threats against dissidents and political opponents linked to the Iranian state apparatus.This stabbing raises concerns among journalists at Iran International and the BBC Persian Service about their safety, especially considering the reported plot to assassinate journalists Fardad Farahzad and Sima Sabet in 2022. The Metropolitan Police has been actively investigating threats from Iran targeting UK-based journalists for Persian-language media outlets, including plots to kidnap or kill individuals perceived as Tehran's enemies.In response to the escalating threats and harassment from Iran, including the assassination attempts, the UK government last year introduced a tougher sanctions regime against Iran for alleged human rights violations and hostile actions against its opponents on UK soil. The attack on Zeraati underscores the ongoing risks faced by journalists and dissidents living in the UK from foreign state actors.(With inputs from agencies)|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108888899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20586,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"This is going to definitely be a complicated time for the royal family ."Charles' desire for a 'slimmed-down' institution was designed to counter accusations it was bloated, with distant relatives living off taxpayer-funded handouts.But there are now gaping holes in his immediate circle - most dramatically, with the departure of his younger son Prince Harry , 39, and wife Meghan , the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to the U.S. three years ago.Meanwhile, Charles' younger brother Prince Andrew, 64, was banished from public life in 2019 over his friendship with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.NOT A GOOD IDEA"Well, I think the 'slimmed-down' was said in a day when there were a few more people around to make that seem like a justifiable comment," the king's younger sister Princess Anne said in an interview last year."It doesn't sound like a good idea from where I'm standing, I have to say. I'm not quite sure what else ... we can do."Of the remaining official working royals - those that carry out duties for the king, such as opening new buildings, giving out honours and meeting foreign dignitaries - many are now from the late Queen Elizabeth's generation.Princess Alexandra, 87, her cousin and long-time friend, is rarely seen in public nowadays, while Elizabeth's other cousins Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, and Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, are 88 and 79 respectively.Princess Anne often tops the list for being the hardest-working royal but she herself will turn 74 this year. Her son Peter Phillips said this week she was probably working a lot harder than she had expected."She's still doing overseas trips and turning around in 24 hours which is pretty hard on most people ... but when you're in your 70s and doing that it's pretty remarkable," he told Sky News in Australia.He said there was "definitely a short-term pressure on certain members of the family to continue to be out and about". As well as his mother, he noted the amount being done by Camilla and Charles' younger brother Prince Edward and wife Sophie, now the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.Royal biographer Claudia Joseph said while Camilla and William had done a "sterling job" in the absence of Charles, it would not have been easy."On a personal level, it's going to be awful for the royals," she said. "Obviously, on a practical level, it makes things difficult."Although polls show most Britons remain generally supportive of the monarchy, they also suggest that majority is shrinking, with a growing gap between enthusiastic older people and indifferent younger generations.Apart from William and Kate, the next youngest working royals are Edward, who this month turned 60, and Sophie who will reach that same milestone next year.It will then be at least a decade until the ranks are swelled by the children of William and Kate.Royal author Tina Brown said the monarchy was looking very lean indeed, putting "unmanageable pressure" on William and Kate."Catherine is the most popular member of the royal family after William," she wrote in the New York Times this week. "The future of the monarchy hangs by a thread, and that thread is her."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108879938,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1375261,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

He is accused of paying bribes to Indian officials to help AgustaWestland win a deal for 12 helicopters worth euro 556.2 million (Rs 5,011 crore) in February 2010. The ED, in its charge-sheet filed in June 2016, had alleged that Michel received euro 30 million (about Rs 270 crore) from AgustaWestland. As a result of the corruption allegations, India cancelled the contract in 2013.Michel, however, claims his extradition from Dubai to India was quid pro pro for the handing over by India of Princess Latifa, daughter of Dubai’s ruler, to the Dubai authorities, on March 4, 2018.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last raised Michel’s case with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sept 9 at the New Delhi G20 Leaders' Summit.Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, UK minister for South Asia, who regularly raises Michel’s case with his Indian counterparts, most recently raised this case with home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Feb 22.Consular staff at the British high commission in Delhi regularly visit Michel in detention, most recently on March 27, TOI was told. Officials in the Foreign Office are in contact with Michel’s family, and last met them on Nov 30, 2023.In 2021 Michel began a hunger strike in Tihar Jail, saying this was his only way to get his voice heard. Last week the Supreme Court refused to entertain his bail plea.A UK govt spokesperson told TOI: “We continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Michel and his family…”On Nov 27, 2020, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had issued an opinion ruling that Michel was being arbitrarily detained by India and called for his release by May 27, 2021. But India at the time said the opinion was not legally binding.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108860325,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-733423,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

No form of extremism is acceptable in the UK, and we have a duty as govt to disrupt and counter violent, divisive ideologies, whatever their manifestation.”Dabinderjit Singh, principal adviser of the Sikh Federation (UK), said: “When this news broke we were inundated with inquiries. We told everyone who asked it was almost certainly fake news… It was immediately brought to the attention of Tom Tugendhat, the UK security minister, as another example of the use of fake news from Indian media sources to promote transnational repression. The fact the UK govt and Indian authorities were silent added to our suspicion it was fake, but we have made clear to UK ministers and politicians they need to call out such fake news that only causes harm.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108860264,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-410116,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Although there was no direct mention of the health challenges faced by the royal family, this marked the king's first public statement since his daughter-in-law disclosed her chemotherapy treatment. Referring to the service that dates back to 600 AD, Charles highlighted the significance of extending friendship, particularly in times of need.“Example of how we should serve and care for each other, and how as a nation we need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need," he said.The ceremony, which symbolizes the Last Supper where Jesus humbly washed his disciples' feet, no longer involves sovereigns washing the feet of the less fortunate as was done in medieval times. Instead, Queen Camilla distributed purses containing special coins, known as Maundy money, to 75 women and 75 men, reflecting the king's age."The service reminds me of the pledge I made at the beginning of the Coronation Service — to follow Christ's example not to be served but to serve. That I have always tried to do and continue to do, with my whole heart,” Charles said in his message.King Charles III, who scaled back public appearances in February to undergo cancer treatment, continues to fulfill his state responsibilities, maintaining regular meetings with the prime minister and handling government matters.Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales , formerly known as Kate Middleton , disclosed last week that she is also undergoing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer following abdominal surgery earlier this year.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108855453,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1375260,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Duke of Sussex's legal fight against the Home Office , stemming from the downgrading of his security after relocating to the US with Meghan Markle, has sparked significant financial and public interest repercussions.As per a Daily Mail report, the expenditure, amounting to £514,128, was directed towards defending against two separate judicial review claims Harry initiated following his departure from royal duties. This sum encompasses over £180,000 for barristers, £320,000 allocated to the Government's legal department, and additional costs in court fees and document disclosures. The total cost is anticipated to rise as Prince Harry has signaled intentions to appeal last month's ruling, which did not favor his case.The judicial review scrutinized the Home Office's decision led by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec). Prince Harry argued this decision unjustly jeopardized his and his family's safety, accusing the committee of unfairly singling him out compared to other VIPs. The Home Office defended its stance by highlighting the necessity to allocate Britain's finite public resources judiciously, reserving police protection for those in roles benefiting the state, the Daily Mail report said.Ultimately, a High Court judge deemed the decision to revoke Prince Harry's automatic round-the-clock police protection—opting instead for a case-by-case security assessment—was lawful. This verdict has left Prince Harry facing an estimated legal bill of £1 million.Beyond this specific legal challenge, Prince Harry is engaged in other legal battles, including lawsuits against News Group Newspapers and Associated Newspapers. Despite these ongoing disputes, a recent libel claim against The Mail on Sunday was dropped, resulting in an additional estimated legal cost of £750,000 for the Duke.As Prince Harry's efforts to challenge the decisions affecting his family's safety and privacy continue, the financial implications of these legal battles weigh heavily on taxpayers, raising questions about the costs associated with public figures' security and the broader implications for royal and government accountability.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108841982,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-377841,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

NEW DELHI: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were reportedly made aware of Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis at the same time as the rest of the world, through a television broadcast. This revelation comes amid discussions on the family dynamics within the British royal family and how significant news is shared among its members.Kate Middleton, the 42-year-old Princess of Wales, recently ended widespread speculation about her health by publicly disclosing her cancer diagnosis in a video message.She revealed that following a planned abdominal surgery, doctors discovered the presence of cancer. "My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment," she explained, describing the diagnosis as a "huge shock."Kensington Palace has since expressed optimism about her recovery, yet the manner in which Prince Harry and Meghan Markle learned of the news underscores the current state of their relationship with the rest of the royal family.According to The Times of London, the Sussexes were not pre-informed of Kate's health condition. A family source highlighted to PEOPLE the apparent lack of communication: "There is clearly no trust.” This sentiment was echoed by royal historian Richard Fitzwilliams, who told TIME, "It speaks volumes that Harry and Meghan learnt of the diagnosis from the news."The strained relations, further detailed in Harry's memoir "Spare" and the Netflix docuseries "Harry & Meghan," suggest deep-seated issues within the family, historically dubbed The Fantastic Four by the British media.As per a report in the Time magazine, despite the challenges, there is speculation that Kate's diagnosis might offer a chance for the family to come closer during this difficult time. "A serious illness can change everything and bring families together. This may happen," Fitzwilliams posited, suggesting that Harry's recent visit to King Charles III, following his own cancer diagnosis, could mark the beginning of a reconciliation.In response to Kate's announcement, Harry and Meghan extended their wishes for her "health and healing" and expressed their hope for the family to manage this privately and peacefully. There have also been reports of direct communication between the Sussexes and the Cambridges, potentially signaling a thawing of relations.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108841065,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1081040,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The ED has argued that the apartment's assets are proceeds from a massive fraud on the Punjab National Bank (PNB), for which Modi faces extradition proceedings.Master Brightwell accepted representations from the ED to hold the proceeds from the sale in a secure account after clearing all pressing liabilities of the trust associated with the property. “I am satisfied that it is a reasonable decision to allow for the property to be sold for GBP 5.25 million or above,” Master Brightwell concluded.While allowing the sale, the judge also noted objections raised by the ED regarding the creation of the trust, though these were not pursued at this stage of the case. Barrister Harish Salve, representing the ED, indicated that the sale was agreed to in principle, ensuring the protection of the interests of the ultimate beneficiary, potentially the Indian exchequer.The proceedings revealed the complex nature of the case, with Nirav Modi asserting himself as the "true settler" of the trust and claiming entitlement to proceeds from the sale. However, arrangements with Indian authorities prevented Modi's sister and her adult children, named beneficiaries in the trust, from participating in the proceedings.During the hearing, Nirav Modi, clad in casual attire, raised concerns about the proposed buyer's potential involvement in another money laundering case investigated by the ED. The court inserted a caveat into the order to consider the proposed purchaser carefully.Nirav Modi's legal battles continue even as he remains in custody. Despite losing his extradition appeal in 2022, further pending litigation surrounds his case. Recent court judgments have also ordered repayment of loans owed by companies connected to Modi.Nirav was arrested in 2019 on charges related to the PNB loan scam and faces multiple criminal proceedings in India. His extradition has been ordered by the UK home secretary, pending resolution of legal challenges.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108837658,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58744,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lord-ranger-is-vindicated-as-ex-employee-loses-appeal/articleshow/108829936.cms|Lord Ranger is vindicated as ex-employee loses appeal|LONDON: A British judge has thrown out an appeal brought against the strike-out of a case against British Sikh Tory peer and donor Lord Ranger and his company, Sun Mark , by a former female Indian Sikh employee.Employment judge Hyams had, in Feb 2023 at Watford employment tribunal , struck out the woman’s claim relating to harassment and discrimination against Ranger, Sun Mark CEO Harmeet Ahuja, Sea, Air and Land Forwarding and Sun Mark, whereby she was seeking compensation of £673,000.President of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Justice Eady, on March 21 dismissed the appeal brought by the woman against her claim being struck out, instead upholding the 2023 ruling that her conduct was “scandalous, unreasonable and vexatious” and agreeing that she had deliberately frustrated the course of justice by destroying evidence, namely a notepad and a mobile phone.The claim brought by the woman centred on a phone call that she had covertly recorded on a mobile, without Ranger’s knowledge, and a notepad in which she claimed to have recorded events that relate to her claim.In May 2021 Ranger’s lawyers wrote to her lawyers asking to see the notebook and phone to have them forensically examined. On Oct 30, 2022 the woman sent a witness statement to the tribunal claiming both had been destroyed in Dec 2020. She said the pad had been burnt by her husband and she had thrown the phone away as it contained intimate pictures of her and her husband which she did not want anyone in her community to see.Hyams concluded she either destroyed them in Oct 2022 or lied about having destroyed them, that it was no longer possible to have a fair hearing, and struck out her claim.The woman appealed arguing that striking out her claim was “unjustifiably draconian”, and that in dismissing her fears regarding intimate photographs Hyams failed to have regard to her ethnic, cultural and religious background.Eady ruled that Hyams was entitled to conclude the evidence was relevant and that the woman’s behaviour was designed to frustrate the doing of justice. “Dealing with the case justly meant it was both proportionate and appropriate for the claim to be struck out,” she ruled.Sun Mark said: “The ruling brings to an end a six-year legal battle, vindicating the decision to robustly defend the businesses and its senior leadership against disputed claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. This has considerably affected Lord Ranger’s health and reputation.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108829937,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-963555,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Putin's political rival, Alexei Navalny , passed away recently, leaving other critics either in jail or exile.The 71-year-old leader faced token opposition from Kremlin-friendly parties , with no significant challenges to his rule or Ukraine invasion. Despite boasting of Russian successes, a Ukrainian drone attack highlighted the ongoing challenges. The defense ministry reported downing 35 drones, with no casualties reported.Russia 's economy, despite sanctions, has shown resilience, with the defense industry driving growth. The scattered opposition urged protests through voting, supported by Navalny before his death. Voting occurred across the country's time zones, including annexed regions of Ukraine and online, with reports of vandalism at polling stations. Incidents included a professor imprisoned for attempting to disrupt voting and a woman fined for spoiling her ballot.Putin framed the Ukraine conflict as a battle against the West, emphasizing recent gains despite Ukrainian resistance. Air raid sirens sounded in a border city, where casualties were reported. The defense ministry claimed to thwart Ukrainian incursions, following reports of armed groups entering Russian regions.Western leaders criticized the election, pointing out limited monitoring opportunities for independent observers.

The ongoing Ukraine war has overshadowed the election, expected to secure President Vladimir Putin another six years in power, amidst sporadic protests.The Russian foreign ministry alleged that Kyiv has escalated 'terrorist activities' to impress Western allies and seek more support. One incident involved a Ukrainian drone dropping a shell near a voting station in a Russian-controlled area. Despite no casualties reported, tensions remain high between the two nations. In response, Medvedev warned of severe consequences, stating that those responsible could face treason charges of up to 20 years. He linked the incidents to the ongoing conflict, accusing Ukraine of aiding attackers. Meanwhile, on the final day of voting, supporters of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for nationwide protests against Putin.Russian media reported Putin receiving military reports of thwarted attacks by saboteurs near the border regions. Ukrainian intelligence officials noted the emergence of armed groups opposing the Kremlin, turning regions into 'active combat zones.' The groups, including the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Siberian Battalion, were described as gaining strength with unified principles.In response, Ukrainian military intelligence vowed to support these groups. In regions near the border, attacks from Ukraine have become routine, with reports of casualties and missile strikes. Despite tensions escalating, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy highlighted the country's ability to target Russia's energy industry, showcasing its military capabilities. Amidst the conflict, Putin's dominance remains unchallenged, with high voter turnout in support of his continued leadership.The election features three other candidates, but none pose a significant threat to Putin's rule. Turnout rates, especially in regions like Belgorod, exceed expectations, indicating strong support for Putin. Additionally, Russia's governing party faced cyberattacks, allegedly originating from Ukraine and Western countries, disrupting web traffic.

Navalny's mother and father attended a small funeral in a Moscow church, surrounded by police. A photograph of Navalny's body in a flower-laden coffin circulated on social media. Inside the church, an Orthodox priest conducted a short service while outside, people chanted Navalny's name.After the funeral, some chanted slogans such as "Russia will be free" and "Putin is a murderer." Navalny, known as President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic, died at the age of 47 in an Arctic penal colony on February 16.His supporters believe he was murdered, while the Kremlin denies any state involvement. Navalny's movement has been outlawed as extremist and his supporters have been labeled as US-backed troublemakers.The funeral took place ahead of a presidential election where Putin is expected to win another six-year term. Security was tight at the church, with people queuing in an orderly fashion to pay their respects. Mourners expressed their support for Navalny's family and praised Navalny for his fearlessness and speaking out against the authorities. Navalny's body was later taken to the Borisovskoye cemetery.Over a quarter of a million people watched the events on Navalny's blocked YouTube channel. Allies of Navalny outside Russia called on people to attend memorials to Soviet-era repression in their own towns.The Kremlin warned that any unsanctioned gatherings in support of Navalny would violate the law. Navalny's wife and children, who are living outside Russia, did not attend the funeral. Rights groups advised mourners to bring their passports and water, as well as contact details of lawyers in case of detainment.Navalny was a Christian who criticized Putin's decision to send troops into Ukraine. The church hosting his funeral has supported the Russian army and the war. Navalny's allies accused Putin of having him murdered to prevent his release in a prisoner swap.The Kremlin denies any involvement in his death. Navalny was a prominent figure in Russian politics, organizing protests and exposing corruption. He faced multiple criminal charges, which he claimed were politically motivated. He returned to Russia in 2021 after being treated for poisoning in Germany and was immediately arrested. Putin has not commented on Navalny's death and rarely mentioned him by name in the past.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108143182,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1784196,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

His supporters say several churches in Moscow refused to hold the service before Navalny's team got permission from one in the capital's Maryino district, where he once lived before his 2020 poisoning, treatment in Germany and subsequent arrest on his return to Russia.The Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, which agreed to hold the service, did not mention it on its social media page. Authorities lined the road from from a nearby subway station to the church with crowd-control barriers, and riot police deployed in big numbers early Friday.A hearse set out with Navalny's body toward the church, his team said.Burial was to follow in the nearby Borisovskoye Cemetery, where police also showed up in force.Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, spent eight days trying to get authorities to release the body following his Feb. 16 death at Penal Colony No. 3 in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow.Authorities originally said they couldn't turn over the body because they needed to conduct post-mortem tests. Navalnaya, 69, made a video appeal to President Vladimir Putin to release the body so she could bury her son with dignity.Once it was released, at least one funeral director said he had been "forbidden" to work with Navalny's supporters, the spokeswoman for Navalny's team, Kira Yarmysh, said on social media. They also were unable to find a hearse for the funeral."Unknown people are calling up people and threatening them not to take Alexei's body anywhere," Yarmysh said Thursday.Russian authorities still haven't announced the cause of death for Navalny, 47, who crusaded against official corruption and organized big protests as Putin's fiercest political foe. Many Western leaders blamed the death on the Russian leader, which the Kremlin angrily rejected.It was not immediately clear who among Navalny's family or allies would attend the funeral, with many of his associates in exile abroad due to fear of prosecution in Russia. Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his regional offices were designated as "extremist organizations" by the Russian government in 2021.The politician's team said the funeral would be streamed live on Navalny's YouTube channel.His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, accused Putin and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin of trying to block a public funeral."We don't want any special treatment - just to give people the opportunity to say farewell to Alexei in a normal way," Yulia Navalnaya wrote on X. In a speech to European lawmakern Wednesday in Strasbourg, France, she also expressed fears that police might interfere with the gathering or would "arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband."Moscow authorities refused permission for a separate memorial event for Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on Friday, citing COVID-19 restrictions, politician Yekaterina Duntsova said Thursday. Nemtsov, a 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, was shot to death as he walked on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin on the night of Feb. 27, 2015.Yarmysh also urged Navalny's supporters around the world to lay flowers in his honor Friday."Everyone who knew Alexei says what a cheerful, courageous and honest person he was," Yarmysh said Thursday. "But the greater truth is that even if you never met Alexei, you knew what he was like, too. You shared his investigations, you went to rallies with him, you read his posts from prison . His example showed many people what to do when even when things were scary and difficult."Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said that his funeral had initially been planned for Thursday - the day of Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address - but no venue agreed to hold it then.In an interview with the independent Russian news site Meduza, Zhdanov said authorities had pressured Navalny's relatives to "have a quiet family funeral."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108140579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145584,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

In a video released on Saturday, Navalnaya revealed that Navalny's mother, who desires to have her son's body returned to her, is being subjected to psychological torment by the authorities.They have even suggested burying Navalny in the Arctic prison, pressuring his mother to make a hasty decision by claiming that the body is decomposing.Navalnaya passionately pleaded, 'Give us my husband's body . You tortured him while he was alive, and now you continue to torture him in death. You are disrespecting the deceased.'Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition politician in Russia, tragically passed away on February 16 in the penal colony. Following his death, countless Russians flocked to impromptu memorials across the country, offering flowers and lighting candles.Authorities have detained numerous individuals in an attempt to suppress any potential public display of sympathy for Putin's strongest adversary in the upcoming presidential election, which he is expected to win. According to social media reports, officials are reluctant to return Navalny's body to his family due to their fear of a widespread show of support for him.Navalnaya directly accused Putin, an Orthodox Christian, of being responsible for Navalny's demise. She stated, 'No true Christian would ever engage in the actions that Putin is currently undertaking with Alexei's body. What will you do with his corpse? How far will you sink in your mockery of the man you have killed?'Putin is frequently seen participating in religious activities, such as dipping himself in ice water to celebrate the Epiphany and visiting holy sites in Russia. He has been an advocate for what he refers to as 'traditional values,' which he believes are essential to prevent societal degradation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed allegations of Putin's involvement in Navalny's death, labeling them as 'completely baseless and audacious accusations against the head of the Russian state.'Musician Nadya Tolokonnikova, known for her involvement with the band Pussy Riot and her subsequent imprisonment for a protest in Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral in 2012, released a video condemning Putin's hypocrisy. Tolokonnikova, who currently resides abroad, stated, 'We were imprisoned for supposedly disrespecting traditional values. However, no one undermines traditional Russian values more than you, Putin, your officials, and your priests who pray for the countless murders that you commit day after day, year after year. Putin, have a conscience and give this mother her son's body.'Tolokonnikova is one of several cultural figures who have released videos urging Russian authorities to return Navalny's body to his family so that they can hold a proper funeral. Navalny's mother and legal team have been attempting to retrieve his body since last week.On Thursday, Lyudmila Navalnaya, Alexei's mother, announced that investigators had allowed her to see her son's body in the morgue in the Arctic city of Salekhard. She has filed a lawsuit at a court in Salekhard challenging the officials' refusal to release the body. A closed-door hearing has been scheduled for March 4.Navalny's spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Lyudmila Navalnaya was presented with a medical certificate stating that her son died of 'natural causes.'|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107965984,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-680070,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The man had been shot half a dozen times and was run over by the car, according to the Spanish state news agency Efe.Spain's Civil Guard said they found documents on the body that identified the man as a 33-year-old Ukrainian.But police now believe it could be Maksim Kuzminov, who defected last year by flying into Ukraine in a Mi-8 army helicopter with the help of Ukrainian intelligence. Andrii Yusov, a representative of Ukrainian military intelligence, confirmed to local media that the former Russian pilot had died in Spain, but didn't provide details. It is not clear how or why Kuzminov would have travelled to Spain.The head of Russia's foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, told Russian journalists that Maksim Kuzminov was a "traitor and criminal" who became a "moral corpse" as soon as he started planning "his dirty and terrible crime", according to Russian state news agency Tass. Tass also reported that Alexei Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence Council, said Ukraine had suggested Kuzminov remain in Ukraine where he would be protected. Asked about the case, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said he had no information on it.Spain's Civil Guard said they found false documents on a body discovered Feb 13. Spanish state news agency Efe said the body had been hit by half a dozen bullets and was run over by the car used by the attackers. Reports said a burning car - possibly the one used in the attack - was found near the area later but the Civil Guard could not confirm that information.Kuzminov's defection was presented last year as a major coup for Kyiv. At a news conference in Kyiv he said he could not understand why his "beloved motherland" would enter into a war with Ukraine. Other members of the air crew died during his defection. Moscow said Kuzminov killed them; he said they panicked and fled, and may've been killed subsequently.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107865036,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1291635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Federal Security Service (FSB), identified the detainee as a 33-year-old woman who lives in Los Angeles. It said that she had raised money for a Ukrainian organisation that bought weapons and other equipment for Ukraine 's military.Perviy Otdel, a group of Russian lawyers who specialise in cases involving accusations of treason and other politically charged allegations, said that woman had been accused of treason for sending just over $50 to Razom for Ukraine, a New York-based nonprofit organization that sends assistance to the country. Russian news outlet Media Zona identified her as Ksenia Karelina. Otdel identified her as Ksenia (Karelina) Khavana, with Karelina likely being her maiden name.FSB said that woman had been arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg in central Russia. RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, published a video that it said showed the woman, wearing a white hat that covered her eyes, being handcuffed and escorted by masked security service officers.If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.The detention of American citizens on Russian soil in recent years has raised suspicions that Kremlin views them as valuable assets to be traded for high-profile Russians held in custody in US.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107864971,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-804516,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Once, Prince Harry in 'Spare', his memoir, revealed that other royals uphold the same tradition with each other. Harry had written that Princess Margaret once gave him a fish biro (a ballpoint pen).Harry in his book wrote, “Meg had spotted it in a local store and thought I might like it. I held it to the light. It was Granny’s face to a T. I hung it on an eye-level branch. It made me happy to see her there.”Harrold further shared that Charles gave his employees “proper gifts,” too. He has received tea cups and saucers or whiskey glasses from the monarch. “One year I got a lovely water jug," Harrold said.He revealed that royals also gave their staffers their annual “famous Christmas card.”|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106253542,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1530972,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

He also set a fire there. The suspect was then arrested under the helicopter deck of the EMC by the arrest team, the special interventions service," CNN quoted the police spokesperson as saying.The authorities believe that the suspected gunman acted alone."We see his act as a targeted action, but it requires further research to gain clarity about how and why," Westerbeke added.The social media posts by local police described the suspect as tall with black hair, wearing "combat-style" clothes and carrying a backpack. He had a gun in his pocket and was wearing a bullet-proof vest when he was detained, CNN reported citing Westerbeke.CNN affiliate NOS reported that the suspect has a criminal record, including being convicted of animal abuse in 2021.Netherlands ' Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Thursday afternoon expressed his "great dismay" after the two shootings."My thoughts are with the victims of the violence, their loved ones and all those who have been in great fear.

Zelenskyy said that Stoltenberg agreed to make efforts to get Nato members to help provide additional air defence systems to protect Ukraine's power plants and energy infrastructure that were badly damaged in relentless and deadly attacks by Russia last winter.He also reminded the secretary-general of the persistent drone, missile and artillery attacks that often strike residential areas and were blamed Thursday for at least three civilian deaths in the past day."In the face of such intense attacks against Ukrainians, against our cities, our ports, which are crucial for global food security, we need a corresponding intensity of pressure on Russia and a strengthening of our air defense," Zelenskyy said.Stoltenberg said that Nato has contracts for 2.4 billion euros (USD 2.5 billion) in ammunition for Ukraine, including 155 mm Howitzer shells, anti-tank guided missiles and tank ammunition."The stronger Ukraine becomes, the closer we come to ending Russia's aggression," Stoltenberg said. "Russia could lay down arms and end its war today. Ukraine doesn't have that option. Ukraine's surrender would not mean peace. It would mean brutal Russian occupation. Peace at any price would be no peace at all."Ukraine has pushed to join Nato and Stoltenberg reiterated Thursday that Ukraine's future is in the trans-Atlantic military alliance and that it would stand with Kyiv as long as it takes.The Kremlin views Ukraine's potential membership in Nato as an existential threat, and Russia said that preventing Ukraine from joining the alliance is one of the reasons for its invasion.On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had said the attack on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Crimea had been coordinated with the help of US and UK security agencies, and that Nato satellites and reconnaissance planes also played a role.Ukraine said without providing supporting evidence that the attack had killed 34 officers and wounded 105 others. But it also claimed to have killed the fleet's commander, Adm. Viktor Sokolov, who was shown on Russian state television on Wednesday speaking with reporters in the Black Sea city of Sevastopol.Unconfirmed news reports said Storm Shadow missiles provided to Ukraine by the UK and France were used in the attack on the Russian navy installation. The UK Ministry of Defence, which in the past has declined to discuss intelligence-related matters, didn't comment on Zakharova's remarks.The meeting with Stoltenberg came on the same day that France's defence minister met with Zelenskyy to discuss how to keep supplying weapons to the war effort. On Wednesday, the UK defence secretary reaffirmed the British government's support and pledged to provide more ammunition as Ukraine's counteroffensive plods forward toward the season when damp and cold weather could slow progress.French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu brought a delegation that included about 20 representatives from French defence contractors who manufacture drones, robots, artillery, ammunition and employ artificial intelligence and cybertechnology.Having donated air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and other weaponry and support to Ukraine, France is anxious not to deplete its own defences.But the French government is exploring other ways to help Ukraine sustain its war effort. Lecornu said that it would transfer fewer weapons to Ukraine, but make direct acquisitions, sometimes with French subsidies, for the Ukrainian army."It's also a way for us to hold on for the long term and also lastingly install France's interests in Kyiv," Lecornu said in comments carried by French broadcaster BFMTV.UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, who hosted a Ukrainian family in his home for a year, told Zelenskyy that he was personally aggrieved by what his country had endured."Our support for you, for Ukraine remains absolutely undented," Shapps said in a video posted by Zelenskyy. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with you. We feel your pain of what's happened and we want to see a resolution, which is the resolution that you want and require."Zelenskyy said Thursday that Ukraine is working on a plan that will outline practical steps for it to align with the principles and standards of Nato."And it is very important that the allies have agreed that Ukraine does not need an action plan for Nato membership," Zelenskyy said.During Nato's annual summit this summer in Lithuania, members pledged more support for Ukraine but stopped short of extending an invitation for the country to join the alliance. Nato leaders said they would allow Ukraine to join the alliance "when allies agree and conditions are met." They also decided to remove obstacles on Ukraine's membership path so that it can join more quickly once the war with Russia is over.Stoltenberg was asked about the remains of drones similar to those used by Russia that have been found on several instances recently in Romania near the border with Ukraine.He said there was no indication they were the result of an intentional attack by Russia against a Nato member, but that strikes by Moscow "close to the Romanian borders are reckless and are destabilising."Stoltenberg said that Nato was adding troops, air policing and surveillance to monitor its eastern borders, including Romania."There should be no doubt that Nato is there to defend all allies," he said.Meanwhile, officials in Moldova, which lies between Romania and Ukraine, said that authorities were trying to determine where a "crashed rocket" found in Harbovat Lake had originated. The remains were detonated Thursday in Anenii Noi district near Ukraine's border, Moldova's interior ministry said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104026900,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-622191,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"We were outgunned but we made it look like our army was big and strong and that we were ready to fight.""It worked! We scared them off," he said.As the conflict continued, Ukraine expanded its use of decoys, introducing radar reflectors made from old Russian oil barrels. Remarkably, these decoys cost just about 1,000 Euros to produce, a fraction of the $1.1 million missiles that Russian troops would employ to destroy them.The enterprise chief emphasised that their success was determined by the destruction of these decoys, which signified the preservation of their genuine weapons and the lives of their soldiers, while simultaneously depleting the enemy's valuable arsenal. The adaptability of their designs played a crucial role in the ongoing effectiveness of this strategy, Financial times reported.It is notable that militaries have long used decoy weapons to outmanoeuvre their opponents, such as inflatable tanks in WWII and parachuting dummies meant to simulate an airborne invasion leading up to D-Day.Ukrainian troops have increasingly relied on such cunning strategies and opportunistic attacks to fend off Russian forces, including the creation of wooden replicas of tanks crafted from empty 155mm shell boxes.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103891886,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261330,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Romanian, Bulgarian and Turkish military diving teams have been defusing those that have drifted into their waters.Moscow has also been intensifying attacks on Ukraine's Danube river ports across from Romania since it abandoned a deal to lift a de facto Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.The Black Sea is crucial for shipments of grain, oil and oil products and is shared by Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey, as well as Ukraine and Russia.Romania, both a European Union and NATO member, shares a 650-km (400 mile) border with Ukraine, is host to a US ballistic missile defence system and, as of last year, has a permanent alliance battle group stationed on its territory.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103813899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-495686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The President stressed France’s commitment to opening up more opportunities for Indian students, exemplified by initiatives such as Classes Internationales, 5-year short-stay Schengen visa for alumni and the fact that India is now the largest beneficiary of French academic scholarships, the press release said. President Macron reiterated:“We want to welcome 30,000 Indian students to France by 2030,” and added that, if this goal is met, “I would be the happiest President”.The key features of new programme for Indian students by France include access to world-renowned French higher education institutions across all fields - universities, grandes écoles, engineering, management, sciences, humanities, arts, and other specialised schools and immersion in French culture and language.

Tatami ", a tense thriller centred on a world judo championship, got its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival at the weekend, receiving a standing ovation.The film takes place over the course of the single day of competition as an Iranian judoka champion, played by Farsi-speaking U.S. actress Arienne Mandi, is ordered to fake an injury to avoid a possible match-up with an Israeli competitor.Amir Ebrahimi and Nattiv shot the movie in Georgia, a country Iranians can easily visit. They stayed in separate hotels, spoke English and did not let on that they were making such a politically charged film."I knew there are many Iranians there, so we were trying to keep it calm and secret," said Amir Ebrahimi, who is an award-winning actress and also stars in the film, playing the judoka's increasingly terrified trainer."We were undercover. We knew it was a dangerous thing," said Nattiv, whose previous movie "Golda" premiered at this year's Berlin Film Festival.Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and has banned its athletes from competing against Israelis.In an incident that inspired "Tatami", the International Judo Federation in 2021 gave Iran a four-year ban for pressuring one of its fighters not to face an Israeli.CLAUSTROPHOBICAmir Ebrahimi, who won the best actress award in Cannes in 2022 for "Holy Spider", fled Iran in 2008 for fear of imprisonment and lashings after a private video of her was leaked.She said she had to take time to think through the possible consequences before accepting Nattiv's offer to make the film."What I have learnt about the Iranian government is that as long as you are afraid they can arrest you, they can kill you, they can make trouble around you. But as long as you are not afraid ... it is going to be fine," she said.The film was shot in black and white, using a tight, 4:3 format, like for old television programmes."These women are living in a black and white world. There are no colours. The box is the claustrophobic world they live in. That is the one thing they want to break. They want their freedom," Nattiv said.Children growing up in Iran were made to fear Israel as an implacable enemy, Amir Ebrahimi said - something Nattiv said was also happening in his own homeland, with Iran portrayed as an existential threat.Nattiv revealed he had helped Amir Ebrahimi pay a clandestine visit to Israel, something that Tehran absolutely forbids for its citizens."I loved it. We could be from the same nation, the same family, we are the same," said Amir Ebrahimi.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103331242,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-819929,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/bavarias-governor-leaves-his-deputy-in-office-despite-a-furor-over-antisemitism-allegations/articleshow/103330508.cms|Bavaria's governor leaves his deputy in office despite a furor over antisemitism allegations|BERLIN: The governor of the German state of Bavaria said Sunday that he will let his deputy stay in office despite a furor that started with allegations he was responsible for an antisemitic flyer when he was a high school student 35 years ago.Governor Markus Soeder , a leading figure in Germany's center-right opposition, said he had concluded that it would be "disproportionate" to fire Hubert Aiwanger, his deputy and coalition partner, but Aiwanger needs to rebuild confidence with the Jewish community and others.Bavaria is holding a state election in just over a month. Soeder's decision drew sharp criticism from political opponents and a cautious response from a Jewish leader.On Aug. 25, the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that, when Aiwanger was a teenager, he was suspected of producing a typewritten flyer calling for entries to a competition titled "Who is the biggest traitor to the fatherland?"It listed, among other things, a "1st prize: A free flight through the chimney at Auschwitz."Aiwanger, 52, said last weekend that one or more copies of the flyer were found in his school bag but denied that he wrote it. His older brother came forward to claim that he had written it.Aiwanger has acknowledged making unspecified mistakes in his youth and offered an apology but also portrayed himself as the victim of a "witch hunt." He stuck to that tone on Sunday, saying at a campaign appearance that his opponents had failed with a "smear campaign" meant to weaken his conservative party.The deputy governor's crisis management has drawn widespread criticism, including from Soeder.On Tuesday, Soeder demanded that Aiwanger answer a detailed questionnaire, and his deputy delivered the answers Friday. Soeder said he had a long conversation with Aiwanger on Saturday evening.Over the past week, there was a steady drip of further allegations about Aiwanger's behavior in his youth, including claims that he gave the Hitler salute, imitated the Nazi dictator and had Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in his school bag. Aiwanger described the latter as "nonsense," said he didn't remember ever giving the Hitler salute and did not rehearse Hitler's speeches in front of the mirror.On Thursday, Aiwanger said: "I deeply regret if I have hurt feelings by my behavior in relation to the pamphlet in question or further accusations against me from my youth. My sincere apologies go first and foremost to all the victims of the (Nazi) regime."Soeder told reporters in Munich that the apology was "overdue, but it was right and necessary." He said that Aiwanger's answers to his questions "weren't all satisfactory," but that he had distanced himself again from the flyer and given repeated assurances he didn't write it."In the overall assessment - that there is no proof, that the matter is 35 years ago, and that nothing comparable has happened since - a dismissal would be disproportionate, from my point of view," Soeder said.But leaders of Bavaria's governing coalition agreed "it is important that Hubert Aiwanger work on winning back lost trust," and should hold talks with Jewish community leaders, Soeder added. He said that was discussed Sunday with Bavarian and German Jewish leaders.One of them, Munich Jewish community leader Charlotte Knobloch, said in a statement that Aiwanger "must restore trust and make clear that his actions are democratically and legally steadfast." She said recent days had been "an enormous strain."The allegations put Soeder, who is widely considered a potential candidate to challenge center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the 2025 national election, although he has denied such ambitions, in an awkward position.Aiwanger leads the Free Voters, a party that is a conservative force in Bavaria but has no seats in Germany's national parliament. He has been the state's deputy governor and economy minister since 2018, when his party became the junior partner in a regional government under Bavaria's long-dominant center-right Christian Social Union.Soeder, the CSU leader, made clear again Sunday that he wants to continue the coalition with the Free Voters, a more or less like-minded party, after the Oct. 8 state election. He dismissed the idea of switching to a coalition with the environmentalist Greens.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser accused Soeder of putting political tactics first."Mr. Aiwanger has neither apologized convincingly nor been able to dispel the accusations convincingly," she told the RND newspaper group. Instead, she said, he has styled himself as a victim "and doesn't think for a second of those who still suffer massively from antisemitism.""That Mr. Soeder allows this damages the reputation of our country," she added.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103330554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1395687,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Thirtyfive animals were lost, they were burned," he said. "The rest have burns and we don't know if they can survive."The charred body of a goat lay on the scorched ground of what was left of the enclosure. One of the 19 animals who survived bleated as Raptis grabbed its face to reveal the burns on its ear.Last year, when another fire in Evros burnt half of the stable, Raptis managed to save all his livestock. But the latest blaze, which came very close to the stable a few days ago, burnt it to the ground on Saturday."The same happened five days ago but we had made it on time, we saved them. Yesterday it was a complete destruction," he said.Summer wildfires are common in the Mediterranean nation but the government has said that extremely dry, windy and hot conditions that scientists link to climate change have made them worse this year, forcing thousands of evacuations.The blaze was largely contained on Sunday although more people were evacuated overnight, fire brigade spokesperson Ioannis Artopoios told Skai radio station.But it could flare up at any time, he added.Raptis hoped the state would offer him any kind of help."There is no other way. How are we going to get through?"|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103330451,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-670827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-passes-law-granting-communist-party-more-control-over-cabinet/articleshow/108389656.cms|China passes law granting Communist Party more control over cabinet|BEIJING: China's parliament on Monday revised a law to effectively grant the Communist Party more executive control over China's cabinet, the State Council , after cancelling the premier's post-parliament news conference for the first time in three decades.The amended State Council Organic Law passed by 2,883 delegate votes, with eight opposing and nine abstaining, during the closing day of the National People's Congress in Beijing.It was the latest in a series of measures in recent years that have gradually eroded the executive authority of the State Council, helmed by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, which nominally oversees China's 21 government ministries as well as local governments.Legal experts say the amendment of the State Council Organic Law for the first time since 1982 continues a trend of transferring more power from the state into the Party's hands, leaving the government to faithfully implement Party directives.Newly added articles stress that the State Council must "resolutely uphold the Party Central Committee 's authority and its centralised and unified leadership" and follow Xi Jinping Thought, the party's name for the president's signature ideology, which expounds on subjects ranging from diplomacy to culture."This is a significant shift in the reorganization of executive authority in China," said Ryan Mitchell, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "While it is always clear that the head of the Party is the most influential figure in the overall hierarchy, the exact division of labour in policymaking and, especially, oversight of policy execution, can be opaque."Li Hongzhong, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said in an address last week to parliament that the revision is intended to "deepen reform of party and state institutions" and "fully implement the Constitution", which was changed in 2018 to reassert the Party's leadership over everything."It is yet another sign that the Party is both increasing its overt control over state organs and wants to be seen as fully in charge," said Thomas Kellogg, professor of Asian law at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C."Politics is in command, and both Party cadres and government bureaucrats are meant to pay ever-closer attention to the Party's dictates and ideological directives as the key guide for day-to-day decision-making," he added.The cancelled post-parliament news conference for the premier is traditionally one of the most widely followed events on Beijing's economic and policy calendar.Since taking power in 2012, Xi has established several new central party committees overseeing multiple ministries that report directly to him. Some even encroach on economic and financial policy, traditionally viewed as falling under the premier's remit.China last year unveiled a sweeping government re-organisation that created a new Party entity to oversee some ministries. Shortly afterwards, the State Council also amended its working rules to clarify that executive decision-making power lies within the Party.Since the new working rules passed, the State Council also no longer holds weekly meetings, instead gathering two or three times a month.Kellogg also cited the scrapping of the premier's news conference as "another example of state governance institutions falling by the wayside" in favour of the Party."We're still in the middle of this years-long transformation of the Party-state structure, with likely more such changes to come," he said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108389827,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1497251,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

On Friday, a few dozen relatives of the passengers met officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing as part of their long journey for answers. They also visited the Malaysian Embassy to present their demands.Even after such a long time, the wound remains raw for many of the families.Friday is the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of flight MH370 . The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014, but took a sharp turn south and fell off the radar. It never made it to Beijing.The plane's disappearance drew attention from around the world and has generated countless conspiracy theories. Only debris from the aircraft has been found.The majority of the plane's passengers, 154, were Chinese.Among the families were elderly parents who lost adult children."Where did the plane go? Where is the person?" said Li Shuce, who lost his son on the flight. "If he's alive I want to see him; if he's dead, I want to see his body."Li was surrounded by police, who were managing the crowd in front of the building where the families met government officials. They corralled journalists behind a barrier made of ropes and a whiteboard.Later, the families went to the Malaysian embassy in Beijing where they chanted in front of the building, "Malaysia, return my loved one! Without seeing them, we won't give up."Another woman who gave only her last name, Gao, because she was concerned about police harassment, said she believed her husband's death last year was precipitated by not knowing the circumstances of their son's death: He was returning from a vacation with his wife and 3-year-old daughter in Malaysia when the flight vanished.Gao and her husband belonged to a generation that could only have one child because of China's one-child policy, which has since been relaxed."My only request, I just want to know what happened to him. We need this," said Gao, a Beijing resident."I don't have any other requests." She said she didn't care about possible compensation from the airline, which a Chinese court is holding hearings on.The families are still holding out hope for answers. Last week, Malaysian officials said they would consider restarting the effort to find the aircraft, after a US company that conducted a previous search proposed another attempt.Gao said she has forced herself to carry on living for her family."How could I give up? If I don't stand up, how can I face them? When you meet these type of situations, you have to act for yourself, you have to be strong."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108325403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1757441,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Taiwan on Thursday defended the actions of its coast guard after two people on a Chinese speedboat, which got too close to a frontline Taiwanese island, died when their boat overturned while trying to flee a coast guard ship.Two others survived.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained in recent years about Chinese fishing boats and other vessels operating in Taiwan-controlled waters, especially around the Kinmen and Matsu islands which sit a short distance from China's coast. China has condemned Taiwan's actions and labelled the incident near Kinmen's Beiding islet "wicked".China's coast guard said it will strengthen its maritime law enforcement forces and carry out regular patrols and inspections in the waters around Kinmen and Xiamen, one of the Chinese cities Kinmen faces. This is to "further maintain the order of operations in the relevant waters and safeguard the safety of fishermen's lives and property", it added. Late on Saturday, China's Taiwan affairs office said the deaths had caused "strong indignation" in China. It also said that there was no such thing as "restricted" waters.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107802617,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-687023,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Notably, China's Communist Party considers Taiwan as its territory, despite never having controlled it.According to Taiwan News report, gray zone tactics are "an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one's security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force."It is not the first time China has made such a move. On Friday, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence (MND) said that eight Chinese military aircraft and five naval ships were detected operating around Taiwan between 6 am (local time) on Thursday and 6 am (local time) on Friday (local time), Taiwan News reported.According to Taiwan's MND, of the eight People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, two crossed the Taiwan Strait median line in the northeast sector of the country's air defence identification zone (ADIZ). Furthermore, one PLA aircraft entered the southwest corner of the ADIZ.In response to China's action, Taiwan sent aircraft and naval ships and deployed air defence missile systems to keep a watch on the activity of China's PLA, Taiwan News reported."8 PLA aircraft and 5 PLAN vessels were detected operating around Taiwan up until 6 a.m.(UTC+8) today. 3 of the aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's Sw ADIZ. #ROCArmedForces monitored the situation and employed appropriate forces to respond," Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence posted on X.On January 30, Taiwan's envoy to the United Kingdom Yao Chin-hsiang has urged the United Kingdom and other Western allies to help deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan, Taiwan News reported.Yao Chin-hsiang made the remarks during a Council on Geostrategy public panel event on January 30. He said that the UK should continue to express concern regarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo and actively take concrete measures to defend the freedom of navigation in the region, Taiwan News reported citing Central News Agency (CNA).He stressed that if the Taiwan Strait faces a Chinese military blockade, it would have a catastrophic effect on global economic and trade activities and harm China significantly. Taiwan envoy called it essential for the UK and its allies to make it clear to China that it recognises this reality. Yao Chin-hsiang said that Taiwan wants to be a force for good in the world and it has a responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.Yao stated that Taiwan President-elect Lai Ching-te has said that apart from bolstering national defence, he will seek to engage in cross-strait dialogue based on dignity and equality, according to Taiwan News reported.

If events or meal appointments aren't necessary, they should be avoided, the commentary by a department of the commission said.The PLA commentary follows the removal by President Xi Jinping of Qin Gang as foreign minister in late July after just seven months, the shortest tenure in that post. An investigation found that Qin had an affair while serving as China's ambassador in Washington, Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.Another high-level official, defence minister Li Shangfu, dropped from public view at the end of August, just months after the ouster of generals in the command that manages the country's nuclear arsenal. At the time, the military launched an inquiry into graft cases linked to procurement going back more than five years, roughly coinciding with Li's tenure as head of the equipment department.

ESPO cargoes were offered at discounts as narrow as 50 cents a barrel prior to the deal."We were expecting ESPO prices to continue surging as seen in the past two months," one of the sources said."But now we think the price hike could be capped as some refineries may turn to buy Iranian oil ."China's large private refiners have since earlier this year stepped up ESPO purchases, crowding out smaller refiners, known as teapots, and forced them to look at cheaper alternatives like sanctioned Iranian oil.Iran ramped up crude exports in 2023, with May's outflow hitting a 4-1/2 year high of 1.54 million barrels per day, according to shiptracking data from Kpler.Exports climbed to around 1.6 million bpd in August, or just below 2 million bpd if condensate is included, according an Iranian source familiar with the matter.The abundant supply has widened discounts for Iranian Light crude to about $13 a barrel to ICE Brent in China on a delivered basis from around $10 a barrel last year, even as prices for rival grades, such as Russia's Urals and ESPO crude, have jumped."It's very likely that ESPO buyers split under the pressure from a flood of Iranian crude," another source said."The big private buyers who can afford the higher prices would gobble more ESPO cargoes, while the smaller-scale teapot refiners go to take cheaper Iranian oil."Moreover, teapots may have found another method to bring in Iranian oil without using their limited import quotas which may lead to higher imports soon, a third source said.Currently, only teapots are taking Iranian oil as big private refiners and state-owned firms still shun the sanctioned crude despite cheap prices.Data analytics firm Vortexa estimates China's Iranian oil imports to hit about 1.2 million bpd in August, the highest this year, while Kpler's estimate is at 559,000 bpd so far.Iran is cranking up crude output to 3.4 million bpd by the end of September, after the country announced earlier this month that its oil exports had surpassed 1.4 million barrels bpd, primarily to China, the Iranian oil minister said this week.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103073055,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-75440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Past efforts to tighten security cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo have progressed by fits and starts.Expected major announcements include plans to expand military cooperation on ballistic missile defenses and making the summit an annual event.In the face of deteriorating ties with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, China has grown closer to Russia, with whom it declared a "no-limits" partnership just prior to President Vladimir Putin's full-on invasion of Ukraine last year.It has also sought stronger relations with developing nations in Africa and Central and South America and President Xi Jinping will be attending next week's summit in Johannesburg of the BRICS bloc linking Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102834242,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60874,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/wto-rules-against-china-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-imports/articleshow/102779489.cms|WTO rules against China retaliatory tariffs on US imports|GENEVA: World Trade Organization experts ruled Wednesday that tariffs imposed by China on billions' worth of US imports in retaliation for Washington's steel and aluminium tariffs violated international trade rules. WTO panel set up to help resolve one of numerous disputes within the tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two biggest economies found that China's "additional duties measure is inconsistent" with various articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ).Washington hailed the ruling, with Sam Michel, a spokesman for the US trade representative, saying it recognised that China "illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs".The case revolves around China's decision in April 2018 to impose tariffs on 128 US imports, worth $3 billion, including fruits and pork.That move came shortly after the administration of former US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from China and a number of other countries.Marking a departure from a decades-long US-led drive for free trade, Trump justified the steep tariffs with claims that massive flows of imports to the United States threatened national security.The administration of his successor, PresidentJoe Biden , has taken a less combative tone but has stuck with the tariffs.Separate panels set up by the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body to settle complaints filed over the US steel and aluminium tariffs ruled late last year they too violated international trade rules.Washington has appealed those rulings, which also determined that the inconsistencies found were not justified by the security exceptions provided for in the GATT, as they were not applied in a time of war or during a case of serious international tension.Wednesday's panel ruling did not delve back into whether Washington was justified in claiming national security exemptions.But it acknowledged the US tariffs had been imposed evoking such objectives, and not as so-called safeguard measures imposed to protect domestic industry.It therefore found that an agreement allowing for retaliation against unjust safeguard measures did not apply in this case, as China maintained.The panel recommended that "China bring its WTO- inconsistent measure into conformity with its obligations under the GATT"."China's decision to pursue this dispute highlights its hypocrisy by both suing the United States in the WTO and at the same time unilaterally retaliating with tariffs," Michel said."The panel rightly rejected China's argument that the US Section 232 actions are safeguard measures that may be 'rebalanced' under WTO rules."China can now appeal Wednesday's ruling, but it remains unclear where the cases can go from there.The WTO's appeals tribunal -- also known as the supreme court of world trade -- has been frozen since late 2019, after the United States under Trump blocked the appointment of new judges and demanded a dramatic overhaul.By filing appeals into a void, countries can in effect block others' ability to move forward and request financial compensation for activities deemed illegal by the DSB.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102779622,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49116,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Lai is leading in the polls.When asked at a press conference about Chinese military activity in response to Lai's trip, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang, said it was the responsibility of the armed forces to track any Chinese activities near Taiwan."The national army upholds the principle of 'not afraid of the enemy and not provoking' when facing all activities by the Chinese Communist Party," Sun said.However, Taiwan had not seen any "relatively large-scale" drills or actions by China's military, he said."But this does not mean we will let down our guard or war preparedness determination."Asked whether China would launch more war games around Taiwan in response to Lai's U.S. trip, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin reiterated that China would "take resolute measures to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity". He did not elaborate.Five Chinese warplanes had entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone in the 24 hours up to Tuesday morning, made up of one Su-30, two J-10s and two J-16Ds, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a daily report on Chinese activity.The J-16D is an electronic warfare variant of one of China's most modern fighters.Beijing has launched almost daily military incursions into Taiwan's air defence zone in recent years seeking to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.Lai is due back in Taipei early on Friday, returning via San Francisco.China launched its last round of war games around Taiwan in April, a day after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a trip to California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.Both Taiwan and the United States are aiming for Lai's U.S. stop-overs to be as low-key as possible, saying that such transits are routine. On Sunday, Lai told supporters in New York that Taiwan would not be afraid nor back down in the face of authoritarian threats.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Taiwan Premier Chen Chien-jen appealed for a calm response from China to Lai's U.S. visits, saying such presidential and vice presidential transits have gone on for many years."There is no need for China to take this opportunity to provoke for no reason," Chen said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102752105,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63038,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Drawing comparisons between Israel and the Nazis and Hitler is to cross a red line," Netanyahu said in a statement.Brazil 's presidential palace and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, the Brazilian Israelite Confederation said Lula's remarks were a "perverse distortion of reality" and "offend the memory of Holocaust victims and their descendants" and accused his government of an "extreme and unbalanced" stance on the conflict.Earlier on Sunday, Lula also condemned the suspension of humanitarian aid to the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), urging an investigation into errors without cutting off funding to help those affected by what he called a "genocide.""It's not a war between soldiers and soldiers, it's a war between a highly prepared army and women and children," he said.UNRWA is facing a financial strain following Israel's assertion that 12 out of its 13,000 staff members in Gaza were implicated in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107803139,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-546713,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

An accord, should it be reached, will only come through direct negotiations between the sides, without preconditions.""Israel will continue to oppose the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Such recognition in the wake of the October 7th massacre will grant a huge, unprecedented reward to terrorism and prevent any future peace accord," it said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107802923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1058723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Israeli military last week ordered an evacuation of the thousands of displaced people who were sheltering at the hospital, saying Hamas was conducting military activities there and may have held hostages on its grounds. Hamas has denied the claims.The Israeli military, which raided the hospital on Thursday, said it had detained about 100 people at Nasser hospital. A spokesman for the Gaza health ministry said Sunday that Israeli forces had detained 70 medical personnel and "dozens of patients." Only 25 staff members were left in the complex, he said, adding that the hospital was further hobbled by water and electricity cuts.Meanwhile, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight into Sunday, according to medics, as the US said it would veto another draft UN ceasefire resolution. The US, Israel's top ally, instead hopes to broker a ceasefire agreement and hostage release between Israel and Hamas.But PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would not bow to international pressure to call off its plan for a ground invasion of Rafah, now packed with over 1 million Palestinians.

The airstrikes were conducted early Saturday, following an announcement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from Rafah. This announcement caused panic among the residents, as more than half of Gaza's population is concentrated in Rafah.Many of them have been repeatedly uprooted due to Israeli evacuation orders. The situation is dire, as there are limited options for the displaced civilians to seek safety.The tension between Netanyahu and the Biden administration has been escalating over the past week. US officials have expressed concerns that an invasion of Rafah without proper plans for the civilian population would lead to a humanitarian disaster.Rafah has been a frequent target of Israeli airstrikes, even after civilians were instructed to seek shelter there. In the recent attacks, three airstrikes on residential homes led to the deaths of 28 people, including 10 children. In the neighboring city of Khan Younis, Israeli forces targeted Nasser Hospital, resulting in casualties and hindering the movement of medical staff.The rising death toll of Palestinians, which now stands at almost 28,000 after four months of war, has strained the relationship between Israel and the US. While Israel blames Hamas for using civilian areas as bases for attacks, US officials are calling for more precise strikes.Netanyahu's office stated that Rafah, located at the border with Egypt, is the last stronghold of Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli government believes that eliminating Hamas requires intense military action in Rafah, along with a mass evacuation of civilians. However, the displacement of civilians poses a significant challenge, as the Israeli offensive has caused widespread destruction throughout Gaza.Furthermore, Egypt has expressed concerns about a potential influx of Palestinians crossing the border, as it could jeopardize the long-standing peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. The border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which is mostly closed, serves as a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid.The population of Rafah has significantly increased due to the displacement of people from other parts of Gaza. The city, which had a prewar population of approximately 280,000, is now accommodating an additional 1.4 million people who have sought refuge with relatives, in shelters, or in tent camps.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107581368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1058723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The majority of the people living there are evacuees from other parts of Gaza, according to the United Nations.Netanyahu stated that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will soon enter Rafah, which is Hamas's last bastion.As the IDF's operations progressed south into Gaza, many Palestinians sought safety in the city. However, it is unclear where they will go next, as the border into Egypt has been closed for months.The Israeli Prime Minister's Office explained that it is impossible to eradicate Hamas while leaving four Hamas battalions in Rafah. Therefore, a dual plan for the evacuation of the population and the disbanding of the battalions will be presented to the Cabinet. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's office criticized the military escalation plan, considering a potential evacuation as a real threat and dangerous prelude to Israeli expulsion of Palestinians.The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. Israel launched a counterattack and aimed to eliminate the terrorist group. In the latest development, the IDF soldiers discovered weapons and military equipment in Khan Younis.

Since the war in the Gaza Strip began in October, Iran has used its proxy forces against Israel and its allies. But Tuesday, it said its latest missile strikes had been in response to terrorist attacks within its borders.The strikes raised tensions in a region where conflict has now touched at least five nations. "They are contributing to the escalation of regional tensions - and it must stop," Catherine Colonna, France's minister for Europe & foreign affairs, said.The missile strike in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state, hit a remote mountainous region Tuesday. The strike in Iraq, which has close political and military ties with Iran, hit the Kurdistan capital Irbil around midnight Tuesday and involved ballistic missiles and drones. In both cases, Iran officials said they were going after terrorists they accused of being behind recent attacks on its territory.Iraq and Pakistan rejected Iran's justifications. "Pakistan has always said terrorism is a common threat to all countries in the region that requires coordinated action," a Pakistan statement said, describing it as "even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication."Iran's actions came amid widespread fears that the devastating war in Gaza could become a broader and deadlier regional conflict. Privately, Iranian officials have been saying they want to avoid a larger conflict. But it has set off a low-level conflict between Iranian proxy forces and the US and other Western powers. The Houthis from Yemen have been disrupting global shipping in the Red Sea, while Hezbollah has been launching strikes on northern Israel from Lebanon. Iraqi militias closely linked to Iran have targeted US bases in Iraq and Syria over 130 times in the past three months. In addition to hitting Pakistan and Iraq, Iran has also struck Syria to target Islamic State. So far, there has been no public objection from Syrian government, which is closely allied with Iran.The Iranian strike in Pakistan hit an area where the militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack on the police station in Rask, near Iran's border with Pakistan, is believed to be based. Over the years, both Iran and Pakistan have accused each other of sheltering militants along their shared 900-km border.Tehran points the finger at Jaish al-Adl, a militant group operating in southeastern Iran and on the Pakistan-Iran border, saying it has carried out attacks within Iranian territory. On Dec. 15, Jaish al-Adl attacked a police station in southeastern Iran, killing 11 officers.Pakistan, in turn, has accused Iran of supporting separatists in Balochistan, a southwestern Pakistani province rich in oil and other natural resources that has been the site of an insurgency for decades.The Iranian strike inside Pakistan - mired in political and economic crises - has left its officials facing a difficult decision about whether to retaliate. "If Pakistan hits back, it risks getting drawn into Middle East conflicts it has avoided so far," said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador. "If it does not, it will appear weak yet again, and that will have consequences for the prestige of its armed forces." Muhammad Ashfaque Arain, a former air marshal in Pak air force, pointed to the delicate position Pakistan was in, with a caretaker government in charge until the Feb 8 polls. "The fact that there is no elected government complicates the response."Arain noted that Pakistan was now confronting troubled ties with three of its neighbours. While India has long been an adversary, Pakistan's ties with Afghanistan have also soured, with Islamabad accusing Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to militant groups, including Pakistani Taliban.The strike on Tuesday was not the first time Iranian forces had hit inside Pakistan, but the attack was the deepest inside Pakistani territory. In 2021, Iran retrieved two Iranian soldiers who were being held hostage by Jaish al-Adl inside Pakistani territory. In 2017, the Pakistani Air Force shot down an Iranian drone.

Residents said police detained several people on Sunday who had participated in the clashes but police refused to comment on any arrests.Kirkuk, an oil-rich province in northern Iraq along the fault lines between the Kurdish autonomous region and areas controlled by Iraq's Shi'ite-dominated central government, has been the focus of some of the country's worst post-Islamic State violence.Arab residents and minority groups, who say they suffered under Kurdish rule, have protested the KDP's return to the city.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103328875,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-997977,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Qassam Brigades acknowledged that Hussein was killed in what the group described as an accidental explosion.There was no information about what kind of militant facility was affected in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, or about the extent of damage caused. Gaza's Hamas rulers have a number of training sites and underground facilities used for manufacturing weapons and storing raw rocket material. Accidental explosions have been reported in the past at bomb laboratories and munitions storehouses.Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on the territory, largely to prevent the militants from amassing more weapons. Israel and Hamas have fought four wars and exchanged fire countless times since the Hamas takeover of the crowded Palestinian enclave.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103035582,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The road is designed to connect the village of Arsos, in the Turkish Cypriot north, with the multi-ethnic village of Pyla, which is inside the buffer zone and abuts the Greek Cypriot south."We believe that with this move, the United Nations has lost its neutrality," Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters during a joint news conference with his Bulgarian counterpart.Fidan maintained that Greek Cypriots had been allowed to go ahead with similar road construction projects."The road built by Greek Cypriots towards the Greek population in Pyla was never subjected to obstruction and condemnation by the United Nations," he said. He accused the UN of acting "like a hawk" to block the Turkish Cypriots' project.Earlier, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement rejecting the UN Security Council's condemnation, which is said was "divorced from the realities on the ground."Speaking after a Cabinet meeting late Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the UN peacekeepers' action "unacceptable" and accused the force of bias against Turkish Cypriots.Cyprus was divided along ethnic lines in 1974 following a Turkish invasion that was triggered by a coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the Mediterranean nation's northern third where Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops. Although Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, only the Greek Cypriot south - where the island's internationally recognized government is seated - enjoys full membership benefits.Since 1974, a UN peacekeeping force known as UNFICYP has supervised the de facto cease-fire and maintained a buffer zone between Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces in the north and Greek Cypriot forces in the south.The Security Council welcomed the halt in construction by the Turkish Cypriot side and the removal of equipment and personnel. It called on both sides to show flexibility and support efforts by the UN envoy "to negotiate mutually agreed development in the area concerned."The road would give Turkish Cypriots direct access to Pyla by circumventing a checkpoint on the northern fringe of a British military base, one of two bases that the UK retained after Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960.The Cyprus government perceives the road's construction as a move with a military purpose at a sensitive spot along the buffer zone, which spans 180 kilometers (112 miles).Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it was satisfied with the UN Security Council statement over what it called "a new, serious military breach" of the buffer zone.The ministry said threats and violence against UN peacekeepers were a "crime under international law" and that Cyprus stands in full solidarity with the UN mission on the island."The strong reaction of the international community constitutes a clear response to the unfounded claims of the Turkish Cypriot leadership and Turkey and sends a strong message that such actions will not be accepted," the ministry said.Turkey has described the road as a "humanitarian" project for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot residents of Pyla.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102960646,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It also said the drone could carry electronic surveillance equipment and a camera. Iran’s hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also viewed the drone on Tuesday.“Today, we can firmly introduce Iran as an advanced and technologic nation to the world,” Raisi said in comments aired on state television.He reiterated Iran’s stance about friendly relations with “all countries in the world,” adding that Iran’s armed forces will cut off any hand that will reaches out in an attempt to invade Iran, state TV reported.The Associated Press could not immediately verify the claims about the drone’s capabilities, though an arm of state television shared a video of it taking off from a runway. Long-range drones like the Reaper also require ground stations and satellite communications.Officials in Israel, which flies its own long-range, high endurance drones, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.Iran has in the past captured US drones or pieces of them, but there’s no evidence that it has taken a General Atomics’ Reaper, which is flown by the US Air Force and allied American nations as a “hunter-killer” drone that can operate at high altitudes for long hours and follow a target before attacking. North Korea in July showed off drones mirroring the Reaper, possibly designed from publicly available information about the aircraft.In December 2011, Iran seized an RQ-170 Sentinel flown by the CIA to monitor Iranian nuclear sites after it entered Iranian airspace from neighboring Afghanistan. Iran later reverse-engineered the drone to create their own variants.In 2019, Iran shot down a US Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk in the Strait of Hormuz amid high tensions over its collapsed nuclear deal with world powers.The Reaper also carries special significance for Iran, as one reportedly carried out the 2020 strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.Iran separately said it had provided two types of ballistic missiles to its army and the Guard on Tuesday, including one named for Soleimani.Iran has unveiled a series of drones it describes as capable of long-endurance flights over the last several years. It remains unclear how they’ve been used in combat.But other Iranian drones have been a key element of Russia’s continued war on Ukraine. Tehran has offered a series of contradictory explanations about the drones, first denying they supplied them to Moscow and then claiming they sold drones only before the war began. However, the volume of drones used in the conflict show a steady supply by Iran of the bomb-carrying weapons in the war.In June, the White House said Iran is providing Russia with materials to build a drone manufacturing plant east of Moscow as the Kremlin looks to lock in a steady supply of weaponry.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102957575,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56906,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The Israeli military conducted an arrest raid before dawn in the town of Zababdeh south of Jenin, local medics said.The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that 17-year-old Othman Abu Kharj was fatally shot in the head.The raid came as Israeli security forces were still searching for the Palestinian gunman who carried out a shooting in the northern Palestinian city of Hawara that killed an Israeli father and son on Saturday.The Israeli military said its forces arrested 15 Palestinian suspects in several northern West Bank towns. In Zababdeh, Israeli security forces said they opened fire at residents who threw explosive devices at them.In the southern West Bank, the Israeli army captured two Palestinians who were suspected in a shooting the day before that killed an Israeli woman and seriously wounded a man.The Israeli military said the two suspects confessed during interrogation to involvement in the attack near the Palestinian city of Hebron.Israeli security forces said they also confiscated the rifle used to shoot at the car on Monday. A car without a license plate that was allegedly used to carry out the attack was found burned north of Hebron, said mayor of the town of Halhoul.Palestinian media identified the two suspects arrested near Hebron as Saqer and Muhamad al-Shantir.The Israeli military said that its forces further conducted large-scale searches and arrest raids throughout the West Bank, interrogating 20 Palestinians, confiscating illegal vehicles and arresting an additional 13 suspects near Hebron.Nearly 180 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of this year, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were militants. But stone throwing youths protesting the incursions and those not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.Some 30 people have been killed by Palestinian attacks against Israelis during that time.Israel says the raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks. Palestinians say the raids undermine their security forces, inspire more militancy and entrench Israeli control over lands they seek for a hoped-for future state. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102935816,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1016884,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The rights group cited eyewitness reports of attacks by troops and images that showed dead bodies and burial sites on migrant routes, saying the death toll could even be "possibly thousands."The United Nations has already questioned Saudi Arabia about its troops opening fire on the migrants in an escalating pattern of attacks along its southern border with war-torn Yemen.A Saudi government official, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly, called the Human Rights Watch report "unfounded and not based on reliable sources," without offering evidence to support the assertion.Yemen's Houthi rebels , who allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border, did not respond to requests for comment.Some 750,000 Ethiopians live in Saudi Arabia, with as many as 450,000 likely having entered the kingdom without authorisation, according to 2022 statistics from the International Organisation for Migration . The two-year civil war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region displaced tens of thousands of people.Saudi Arabia, struggling with youth unemployment, has been sending thousands back to Ethiopia in concert with Addis Abba.Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 38 Ethiopian migrants and four relatives of people who attempted to cross the border between March 2022 and June 2023 who said they saw Saudi guards shoot at migrants or launch explosives at groups.The report said the group also analysed over 350 videos and photographs posted to social media or gathered from other sources filmed between May 12, 2021, and July 18, 2023. It also examined several hundred square kilometres of satellite imagery captured between February 2022 and July 2023."These show dead and wounded migrants on the trails, in camps and in medical facilities, how burial sites near the migrant camps grew in size, the expanding Saudi Arabian border security infrastructure, and the routes currently used by the migrants to attempt border crossings," the report said.An April 27 satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press showed the same tent structures identified by the rights group near al-Raqw, Yemen, on the Saudi border. Two sets of fence lines could be seen just across the border into Saudi Arabia.The site Human Rights Watch identified as the migrant camp at Al-Thabit also could be seen in satellite images, which corresponded to the group's narrative that the camp largely had been dismantled in early April.Both areas are in northwestern Yemen, the stronghold of the country's Houthi rebels. The UN has said that the Houthi-controlled immigration office "collaborates with traffickers to systematically direct migrants" to Saudi Arabia, bringing in USD 50,000 a week.The Houthis have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition has battled the Houthis since March 2015, without dislodging them from the capital.Fighting has largely halted between the Saudi-led forces and the Houthis as Riyadh seeks a way to end the war. However, throughout the war years, the Houthis claimed multiple incursions across the Saudi border in this mountainous region.Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. But in recent months, there has been growing concern from the UN human rights body about Saudi forces attacking migrants coming in from Yemen.An October 3, 2022, letter to the kingdom from the UN said its investigators "received concerning allegations of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire allegedly by Saudi security forces causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants.""If migrants are captured, they are reportedly oftentimes subjected to torture by being lined up and shot through the side of the leg to see how far the bullet will go or asked if they prefer to be shot in the hand or the leg," the letter from the UN reads. "Survivors of such attacks reported having to play dead' for a period of time in order to escape."A letter sent by Saudi Arabia's mission to the UN in Geneva in March said that it "categorically refutes" allegations that the kingdom carries out any "systematic" killings on the border. However, it also said the UN provided "limited information" so it could not "confirm or substantiate the allegations."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102918842,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/the-gaza-strip-gets-its-first-cat-cafe-a-cozy-refuge-from-life-under-blockade/articleshow/102838036.cms|The Gaza Strip gets its first cat cafe, a cozy refuge from life under blockade|GAZA CITY: The global cat cafe trend, where people pay to have coffee and hang out with cats, has finally come to the besieged Gaza Strip .In the impoverished Palestinian enclave run by the Hamas militant group and crippled by a 17-year blockade , residents seeking to escape the territory's troubles flocked on Thursday to the new Meow Cafe - Gaza City's answer to the quirky concept tried successfully around the world.The cafe's founder, 52-year-old Naema Mabed, said she envisioned the spot as a unique escape from the pressures of life in Gaza - with its lack of recreational options, a youth unemployment rate of over 60% and frequent rounds of conflict with Israel since Hamas violently seized control of the strip in 2007.At the cozy hang-out, Mabed offers a modest drink service and encourages guests to head straight to the cat corner to pet and play with furry friends. The rules of entry are simple: Visitors must cover their shoes with plastic and wash their hands before cuddling the cats."I have spent my life raising cats, and they're a source of joy and quiet, a release of pressures," Mabed told The Associated Press, as cats roamed around her. She described feline communion as a "global anti-depressant."Her customers seem to agree. They looked exuberant as they played and lounged with the 10 cats in residence, including some named Tom, Dot, Simba and Phoenix. Some guests were quiet as they soaked in the cats' calming presence.The cats are not adoptable, says Mabed, who is strongly bonded to her feline friends."The feeling, honestly, is that you just come to feel the psychological comfort of the cats," said 23-year-old Eman Omar, who had paid the entrance fee of 5 Israeli shekels ($1.30) to spend half an hour snuggling with cats. "Everything is beautiful!"Experts said the cafe does far more than indulge the cat-crazed and give visitors a chance for a good selfie. Psychologist Bahzad al-Akhras said that in places like Gaza such havens can serve as therapy for those scarred from the strip's devastating wars and other hardships."Any place that provides humans a kind of interaction with animals has a positive psychological impact," al-Akhras said.It wasn't easy for Mabed to bring the cat cafe trend to Gaza. Opening shop in the enclave presented a range of challenges - not only financial. The idea of paying to hang out with cats when stray cats roam free on Gaza City's streets every day struck some residents as ridiculous.But for cat-lovers who face travel restrictions because of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and might not experience the wildly popular trend elsewhere, the experience was pure bliss."If you're a cat lover, this is your place," Omar, the customer, said. "If you don't love cats, you will feel the urge to love them."|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102838723,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45864,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

They include Yemen's third-largest city, Taiz, which has been under siege by the Houthis since 2016; Hodeida, where Yemen's main port is located; and the oil-rich eastern province of Marib, which the Houthis attempted to seize in 2021.Yemen's civil war erupted in 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthis swept down from their northern stronghold and chased the internationally recognized government from the capital, Sanaa . A Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year on behalf of the government, and in time the conflict turned into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.The war has devastated Yemen, killing more than 150,000 people and creating one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. The restoration of Saudi-Iran ties in April raised hopes of progress in ending the conflict, but so far there has been none.Grundberg said his recent talks with both sides showed "general willingness to seek solutions, but this still needs to translate into concrete steps, in particular, a clear agreement on the way forward that includes restarting an inclusive Yemeni political process."And against the backdrop of intermittent fighting, he said, the threats to return to war are "not conducive to maintaining a fruitful mediation environment."Grundberg called on both sides "to refrain from escalatory rhetoric" and continue to use channels established under the truce to de-escalate incidents.Last month, Grundberg told the council the fight over economic wealth "has become inseparable from the political and military conflict" and the rivals were now battling over revenue from ports, trade, banking and natural resources.The UN envoy said Wednesday that the Houthis and government are continuing "to resort to antagonistic economic measures to weaken the other side" - tactics that primarily hurt civilians and sow distrust."The government is still being prevented from exporting petroleum products, its major source of revenue, and intra-Yemeni trade in goods and services remains curtailed due to restrictions and the imposition of exorbitant fees and taxes," Grundberg said.He also cited further deterioration in basic services with power stations shutting down due to a lack of fuel and electricity cuts in the southern city of Aden reaching 18 hours a day in stifling summer heat.Edem Wosornu, operations director for the UN humanitarian office, told the council that protests in Aden and surrounding provinces have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the extensive power outages and the decline in the value of Yemen's currency, the rial.In the absence of a resumption of oil exports, she warned that government revenue will continue to dwindle, leading to further cuts in services. And she said obstructions to trade will continue driving the cost of basic goods further out of reach for many Yemenis.Both Grundberg and Wosornu welcomed Saudi Arabia's recent announcement of $1.2 billion to support Yemen's budget.Wosornu said the money will help keep the power on and some salaries paid, but the Saudi funds alone won't be enough "to bring Yemen's economy back from the brink of collapse."While it's vital to make progress on a political solution to the conflict, she said that alone won't solve the humanitarian crisis."Only when such progress is pursued together with improved economic conditions and the re-establishment of essential services will we see humanitarian needs begin to decrease," Wosornu said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-102803710,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115992,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Notably, China's Communist Party considers Taiwan as its territory, despite never having controlled it.According to Taiwan News report, gray zone tactics are "an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one's security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force."It is not the first time China has made such a move. On Friday, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence (MND) said that eight Chinese military aircraft and five naval ships were detected operating around Taiwan between 6 am (local time) on Thursday and 6 am (local time) on Friday (local time), Taiwan News reported.According to Taiwan's MND, of the eight People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, two crossed the Taiwan Strait median line in the northeast sector of the country's air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

He said that the UK should continue to express concern regarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo and actively take concrete measures to defend the freedom of navigation in the region, Taiwan News reported citing Central News Agency (CNA).He stressed that if the Taiwan Strait faces a Chinese military blockade, it would have a catastrophic effect on global economic and trade activities and harm China significantly. Taiwan envoy called it essential for the UK and its allies to make it clear to China that it recognises this reality.

"History takes turns and zigzags," Suleymanov said. "We could not do this earlier and it would probably not be a good idea to do it later.""The stars aligned for certain reasons and President Aliyev saw the alignment," said Suleymanov. Prominent among these "stars" was the new inability or unwillingness of Russia, the West , or Armenia to intervene to protect Nagorno-Karabakh. The self-governed enclave had 10,000 fighters at its disposal, according to Azerbaijan, whose own army - estimated at over 120,000-strong by Western experts - dwarfed it.Karabakh slipped from Azerbaijan's grasp in the chaos that followed the Soviet Union's breakup. In a 1988-1994 war, around 30,000 people were killed and over 1 million displaced, over half of them Azerbaijanis. Aliyev's father, then President Heydar Aliyev, was forced to agree to a ceasefire that cemented Armenia's victory. Ilham, who had succeeded Heydar on his death in 2003, signed an oil deal with a BP-led consortium a year later that gave Azerbaijan funds to start building a modern army.Two senior officials and a source who has worked with Aliyev underscored that the decision to take back the breakaway region took shape over months as diplomatic realities shifted. His actions have loosened Russia's decades-long grip on the strategically important South Caucasus region which is crisscrossed with oil and gas pipelines, lies between the Black and Caspian seas, and borders Iran, Turkey and Russia.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104077360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-569386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japan-working-class-ditches-suits-dons-summer-casuals-for-cool-biz-in-hot-office/articleshow/103914188.cms|Japan working class ditches suits & dons summer casuals for 'cool biz' in hot office|TOKYO: It was the tail end of another long, hot Tokyo summer, and salarymen across the city were looking at their wardrobes with dread. Every year from May to September, Japan 's famously conservative corporate workers and government employees set aside their stiff, dark suits for more casual attire. Out go the neckties and starched shirts; in come short-sleeved polos and linen shirts, even the occasional Hawaiian.Then, as the calendar approaches October, formality returns, if not drastically cooler temperatures. The metamorphosis is part of a Japanese initiative known as " Cool Biz ", a glass-half-full description of what could just as easily be called "Hot Office".Starting May 1, workplaces set their thermostats at 28C to save energy - a sweaty proposition in humid Tokyo. Uncomfortable though they may be, Japanese offices offer a model for how countries around the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions that have contributed to record-breaking heat waves and extreme weather events. This August was the hottest ever recorded in Japan, according to its meteorological agency, and daily highs in Tokyo remained above 32 into the latter part of September.Cool Biz is one of a number of simple, cost-effective energy savings initiatives in Japan, a resource-poor country that relies on fuel imports for nearly 90% of its energy needs. The measures have helped keep Japan's per capita energy consumption to roughly half that of the US, according to statistics from the Energy Institute , based in London. Unlike Japanese workers, Americans have been hostile to the idea of thermal discomfort. During the oil shock of the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter became a national punching bag for daring to ask people to turn down the thermostat and put on an extra layer. In the summer, many American offices are still kept so cold that workers resort to space heaters and sweaters.In Japan, Cool Biz became especially popular with women, who tended to wear lighter clothes and often complained about the cold temperatures needed to make business suits comfortable for their male colleagues. Today, over 86% of workplaces participate in the Cool Biz programme, according to an environment ministry survey. Its success was achieved without any rule-making or financial incentives, said Yusuke Inoue, the director of the ministry's zero-carbon lifestyle promotion office. Instead, the government encouraged politicians and business leaders to strip off their jackets and ties, modeling behaviour that quickly became ubiquitous. As people turned to lighter clothes, they no longer wanted the thermostat set so low, Inoue said.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103914218,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-791248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/pope-gives-noble-chinese-people-a-shout-out-at-mass/articleshow/103327865.cms|Pope gives 'noble' Chinese people a shout-out at Mass|ULAANBAATAR: Pope Francis sent a special greeting to China's "noble" people on Sunday, giving them a special shout-out at the end of a Mass celebrated in neighboring Mongolia during the first-ever papal visit that was largely overshadowed by Beijing and its crackdown on religious minorities.Francis brought up to the altar the retired and current bishops of Hong Kong, Cardinal John Hon Tong and Cardinal-elect Stephen Chow, clasped their hands and told the crowd that included many mainland Chinese pilgrims that he wished them all well."I want to take advantage of their presence to send a warm greeting to the noble Chinese people," Francis said. "To all the (Chinese) people I wish the best and to always go forward, always progress.""I ask Chinese Catholics to be good Christians and good citizens," he added, to cheers from the crowd in the Steppe Arena, in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.It was the first and only time that Francis has publicly mentioned China during his four-day visit, despite the large shadow that Beijing has cast over the trip and Mongolia.China's ruling Communist Party has been waging a years-long, sweeping crackdown on religion, tightening controls, especially on Christianity and Islam that are viewed as foreign imports and potential challengers to Communist authority. The crackdown targeting Uyghurs in the northwestern Xinjiang region has been especially fierce, with claims that more than 1 million ethnic minority members were forcibly sent to prison-like reeducation centers where many have said they were tortured, sexually assaulted, and forced to abandon their language and religion.The U.N. last year accused China of serious human rights violations that may amount to "crimes against humanity;" China has denied targeting Uyghurs and others for their religion and culture, denouncing the accusations as lies by the West and saying its crackdown was aimed at quashing separatism, terrorism and religious extremism.The pope did send a telegram of greeting to President Xi Jinping as his aircraft flew early Friday through Chinese airspace, offering him "divine blessings of unity and peace." The Beijing foreign ministry acknowledged the gesture and said it showed "friendliness and goodwill."But while small groups of Chinese pilgrims attended Francis' main Mass here, no mainland Chinese bishop was believed to have been given permission to travel for the papal visit to Mongolia. Their absence underscored the tenuousness of a 2018 Vatican-China accord over Catholic bishop nominations, which Beijing has violated by making appointments unilaterally.Earlier Sunday, China's crackdown on faith groups was indirectly apparent as Francis highlighted, by contrast, Mongolia's long tradition of religious tolerance: He presided over an interfaith event with Mongolian shamans, Buddhist monks, Muslim, Jewish, Shinto leaders and a Russian Orthodox priest.Sitting among them on a theater stage, Francis listened intently as the faith leaders described their beliefs, their relationship with heaven and the peace and harmony their faiths bring the world. Several said the traditional Mongolian ger, or round-shaped yurt, was a potent symbol of harmony with the divine - a warm place of family unity, open to the heavens, where strangers are welcome."The fact that we are meeting together in one place already sends a message: It shows that the religious traditions, for all their distinctiveness and diversity, have impressive potential for the benefit of society as a whole," Francis said."If the leaders of nations were to choose the path of encounter and dialogue with others, it would be a decisive contribution to ending the conflicts continuing to afflict so many of the world's peoples," he said.Francis is in Mongolia to minister to one of the world's smallest and newest Catholic communities and highlight Mongolia's tradition of tolerance in a region where the Holy See's relations with neighboring China and Russia are often strained. Beijing's crackdown on religious minorities has been a constant backdrop to the trip, even though the Vatican hopes to focus attention instead on Mongolia and its 1,450 Catholics.Hong Kong Cardinal-elect Chow, who made a historic visit to Beijing earlier this year, accompanied 40 pilgrims to Mongolia. He declined to discuss the absence of his mainland Chinese counterparts, focusing instead on the importance of Francis' visit to Mongolia for the Asian church."I think the Asian church is also a growing church. Not as fast as Africa - Africa is growing fast - but the Asian church also has a very important role to play now in the universal church," he told reporters.Chinese President Xi has demanded that Catholicism and all other religions adhere strictly to party directives and undergo "Sinicization." In the vast Xinjiang region, that has led to the demolition of an unknown number of mosques, but in most cases, it has meant the removal of domes, minarets and exterior crosses from churches."We really hope that gradually our government and leaders will accept him and invite him to visit our country," said Yan Zhiyong, a Chinese Catholic businessman in Mongolia who attended an event on Saturday with Francis at the city's cathedral. "That would be the most joyful thing for us."Most Mongolians follow the dominant Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism and revere its leader, the Dalai Lama. As a result, many Mongolians are concerned with the Communist Party's opposition to the exiled Tibetan leader and its heavy-handed control over monastic life and what appears to be a concerted effort to gradually eliminate Tibetan culture.Yet, given the need to maintain stable relations with Beijing - China is Mongolia's top export partner - the country's leaders have not spoken out on the matter, just as they have remained largely silent about repressive linguistic and cultural policies toward their ethnic brethren in China's Inner Mongolia region.Francis also has largely avoided antagonizing Beijing, most significantly by dodging any criticism of Beijing or by meeting with the Dalai Lama.While the Dalai Lama wasn't present Sunday, he was mentioned by the head of Mongolia's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Khamba Nomun Khan Gabju Choijamts Demberel.The abbot noted that "His Holiness," as the Dalai Lama is known, had recently recognized the 10th reincarnation of the head lama of Mongolian Buddhists."This is an extraordinary fortune for us," said the abbot.The recognition has posed a problem, given that China requires all reincarnated lamas to be born within China and be officially certified by Beijing; the newly recognized Mongolian lama meets neither criterion.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103327931,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1449720,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

He added that the registry had notified him of the suspension shortly before the official ratification.Arevalo said he expected a call from current President Alejandro Giammattei to coordinate the transition and to take up the presidency alongside his deputy Karin Herrera on Jan. 14, 2024."These are the official results, and that's what counts in Guatemala," tribunal magistrate Gabriel Aguilera said.Tribunal head Irma Palencia said the citizens registry was a lower authority and underlined that Arevalo was officially the winner.The tribunal said Semilla had three days to file a suit against the suspension order, which Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre said had again come at the request of prosecutors.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103155533,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22600,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

It expects the economy to grow 2.4% in 2024.South Korea's fiscal deficit will widen to 3.9% of GDP next year, from an estimated 2.6% this year, the ministry said, adding that it will bring back the ratio below 3% from 2025. The debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 51.0% from 50.4%."It was a difficult decision the government made to hold onto sound financing," Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho said.About 23 trillion won worth of projects deemed inefficient will be scrapped or scaled down, with more spending on social welfare, childbirth support, investment in key industries, public safety and disaster prevention, among others.Big spending increases include social welfare, up by 7.5% to 242.9 trillion won, defence up 4.5% to 59.6 trillion won and corporate support by 4.9% to 27.3 trillion won.The government will issue 158.8 trillion won of treasury bonds in 2024, down from a total of 167.8 trillion won planned for this year. The net increase in treasury bonds is projected at 50.3 trillion won.It will issue a maximum $1.3 billion worth of foreign exchange stabilisation bonds, compared with $2.7 billion set for this year, and 18 trillion won worth of the bonds in local currency, its first issuance of the kind since 2003, to lower the borrowing cost.The budget plan will be submitted to the national assembly on Friday, Sept. 1.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103152675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-23696,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

However, it is illegal to normalize ties with Israel under a 1957 law in Libya, which has long been hostile toward Israel.Mangoush fled to Turkey following the Israeli announcement of the meeting, according to a Libyan foreign ministry official.Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Mangoush met in Rome last week. It was a small breakthrough for Israel's government, whose hardline policies toward the Palestinians have led to a cooling of its burgeoning ties with the Arab world.Cohen said they discussed the importance of preserving the heritage of Libya's former Jewish community, including renovating synagogues and cemeteries. The talks also touched on possible Israeli assistance for humanitarian issues, agriculture and water management, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.The Libyan foreign ministry, meanwhile, sought to downplay the importance of the meeting as "unprepared and an unofficial meeting during a meeting with Italy's foreign minister." It said in a statement that Mangoush's encounter with Cohen didn't include "any talks, agreements or consultations."Dbeibah's decision to suspend Mangoush suggested that he was not aware of the meeting. However, two senior Libyan government officials told The Associated Press the prime minister did know about the talks between his foreign minister and the Israeli chief diplomat.One of the officials said Dbeibah gave the green light for the meeting last month when he was on a visit to Rome. The prime minister's office arranged the encounter in coordination with Mangoush, he said.The second official said the meeting lasted for about two hours and Mangoush briefed the prime minister directly after her return to Tripoli. The official said the meeting crowned U.S.-brokered efforts to have Libya join a series of Arab countries establishing diplomatic ties with Israel.The official said normalization of relations between Libya and Israel was first discussed in a meeting between Dbeibah, and CIA Director William Burns, who visited the Libyan capital in January.The Libyan premier gave initial approval for joining the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, but he was concerned about public backlash in a country known for its past support for the Palestinian cause, the official said.The official, meanwhile, said Mangoush who was surprised by the Israeli announcement, quickly fled the Libyan capital on a private flight to Istanbul.Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity for their safety.Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow specializing in Libya at the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, said Dbeibah has sought to please foreign governments as he has come under growing pressure from the U.N. and other countries over the political stalemate in his nation.Harchaoui said the Libyan prime minister's decision to suspend his foreign minister "undoubtedly" aimed at calming public anger.Israel's foreign ministry did not respond to reporters' questions early Monday, including whether Cohen's announcement had been coordinated with Libya.An Israeli official, however, said the foreign ministry was forced to go public after an Israeli media outlet planned to publish a report on the meeting. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes diplomacy, said that Israel informed the Libyans about the leak and said that both countries had previously agreed to announce the meeting at an unspecified time.Libya was plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The oil-rich country has been split between the Western-backed government in Tripoli and a rival administration in the country's east. Each side has been backed by armed groups and foreign governments. Gadhafi was hostile to Israel and a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including radical militant groups opposed to peace with Israel.Sunday's announcement of the meeting prompted scattered protests in Tripoli and other towns in western Libya. Protesters stormed the foreign ministry headquarters to condemn the meeting, while others attacked and burned a residence for the prime minister in Tripoli, according to local reports.In the town of Zawiya protesters burned the Israeli flag, while others held the Palestinian flag. There were also protests in the city of Misrata, a stronghold for Dbeibah, according to footage circulated on social media and verified by The Associated Press.Khalid al-Mishri, an Islamist politician who was the chair of the State Council, a Tripoli-based legislative body, condemned the meeting and called for the dismissal of Dbeibah's government, which is close to the U.S. and the West."This government has crossed all prohibited lines and must be brought down," he wrote on the X platform, previously known as Twitter.The east-based House of Representatives also slammed the meeting as a "legal and moral crime." It called for an emergency session Monday in the eastern city of Benghazi.In Israel, Yair Lapid, a former foreign minister and prime minister, criticized Cohen for going public with the sensitive meeting."Countries of the world this morning are looking at the irresponsible leak of the meeting of the Israeli and Libyan foreign minister and asking themselves: is it possible to manage foreign relations with this country? Is it possible to trust this country?" Lapid said in a statement.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103145847,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-662348,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

The National Committee of Arab Local Councils in Israel accused Smotrich of racism.In a statement on Monday, Smotrich appeared to reverse course and said an oversight mechanism had been created to transfer funds to the Arab communities."We are stopping the criminal organisations from taking over the budgets that go to the Arab authorities," Smotrich said.Arab citizens of Israel, most descendants of Palestinians who remained in Israel after the 1948 war surrounding its creation, make up about a fifth of the country's population.Crime in the Arab sector communities is disproportionately high to their makeup of the overall demographic.At least 157 Arab citizens in Israel have been murdered since January, more than double the fatalities over the same period last year and the highest toll since 2014.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103139367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-762755,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

Domestically, their policies are filled with mistakes," Gou said, adding "the era of entrepreneur's rule" has begun."Give me four years and I promise that I will bring 50 years of peace to the Taiwan Strait and build the deepest foundation for the mutual trust across the strait," he said in a plea to Taiwan voters."Taiwan must not become Ukraine and I will not let Taiwan become the next Ukraine."Gou must gather close to 300,000 voter signatures by November 2 to be qualified as an independent candidate, according elections regulations. The Central Election Commission will review the signatures and announce the results by November 14.Taiwan Vice president William Lai, the presidential candidate for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is the favourite to win the election as he leads the polls.Former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je of the small Taiwan People's Party has generally keen running second in the polls, with Hou a distant third.Gou's main theme in his pseudo-campaign events has been that the only way to avoid war with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, is to get the DPP out of office.China has a particular dislike of Lai for comments he has previously made about being a "worker" for Taiwan independence, a red line for Beijing.The DPP champions Taiwan's separate identity from China, but the government it leads has repeatedly offered talks with China that have been rebuffed.The run up to the election is taking place at a time of increased tensions between Taipei and Beijing, as China stages regular military exercises near the island to assert its sovereignty claims.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103116709,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64388,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/meta-faces-backlash-over-canada-news-block-as-wildfires-rage/articleshow/103078346.cms|Meta faces backlash over Canada news block as wildfires rage|MONTREAL: Meta is being accused of endangering lives by blocking news links in Canada at a crucial moment, when thousands have fled their homes and are desperate for wildfire updates that once would have been shared widely on Facebook.The situation "is dangerous," said Kelsey Worth, 35, one of nearly 20,000 residents of Yellowknife and thousands more in small towns ordered to evacuate the Northwest Territories as wildfires advanced.She described to AFP how "insanely difficult" it has been for herself and other evacuees to find verifiable information about the fires blazing across the near-Arctic territory and other parts of Canada."Nobody's able to know what's true or not," she said."And when you're in an emergency situation, time is of the essence," she said, explaining that many Canadians until now have relied on social media for news.Meta on August 1 started blocking the distribution of news links and articles on its Facebook and Instagram platforms in response to a recent law requiring digital giants to pay publishers for news content.The company has been in a virtual showdown with Ottawa over the bill passed in June, but which only takes effect next year.Building on similar legislation introduced in Australia, the bill aims to support a struggling Canadian news sector that has seen a flight of advertising dollars and hundreds of publications closed in the last decade.It requires companies like Meta and Google to make fair commercial deals with Canadian outlets for the news and information -- estimated in a report to parliament to be worth Can$330 million (US$250 million) per year -- that is shared on their platforms, or face binding arbitration.But Meta has said the bill is flawed and insisted that news outlets share content on its Facebook and Instagram platforms to attract readers, benefiting them and not the Silicon Valley firm.- Profits over safety - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week assailed Meta, telling reporters it was "inconceivable that a company like Facebook is choosing to put corporate profits ahead of (safety)... and keeping Canadians informed about things like wildfires."Almost 80 percent of all online advertising revenues in Canada go to Meta and Google, which has expressed its own reservations about the new law.Ollie Williams, director of Cabin Radio in the far north, called Meta's move to block news sharing "stupid and dangerous."He suggested in an interview with AFP that "Meta could lift the ban temporarily in the interests of preservation of life and suffer no financial penalty because the legislation has not taken effect yet."Nicolas Servel, over at Radio Taiga, a French-language station in Yellowknife, noted that some had found ways of circumventing Meta's block.They "found other ways to share" information, he said, such as taking screen shots of news articles and sharing them from personal -- rather than corporate -- social media accounts.'Life and death' - Several large newspapers in Canada such as The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star have launched campaigns to try to attract readers directly to their sites.But for many smaller news outlets, workarounds have proven challenging as social media platforms have become entrenched.Public broadcaster CBC in a letter this week pressed Meta to reverse course."Time is of the essence," wrote CBC president Catherine Tait. "I urge you to consider taking the much-needed humanitarian action and immediately lift your ban on vital Canadian news and information to communities dealing with this wildfire emergency."As more than 1,000 wildfires burn across Canada, she said, "The need for reliable, trusted, and up-to-date information can literally be the difference between life and death."Meta -- which did not respond to AFP requests for comment -- rejected CBC's suggestion. Instead it urged Canadians to use the "Safety Check" function on Facebook to let others know if they are safe or not.Patrick White, a professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, said Meta has shown itself to be a "bad corporate citizen.""It's a matter of public safety," he said, adding that he remains optimistic Ottawa will eventually reach a deal with Meta and other digital giants that addresses their concerns.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103078434,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-399370,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/nigers-military-rulers-order-four-envoys-out/articleshow/103075954.cms|Niger's military rulers order four envoys out|NIAMEY: Niger 's military rulers on Friday gave the French, German, Nigerian and US ambassadors 48 hours to quit the country, amid escalating tension over the threat of military action from the West African bloc Ecowas to reverse the coup .The ultimatum against the French envoy was quickly rejected by Paris, which repeated that it did not recognise the military rulers' authority.The move by the officers now running the country was the latest escalation in deteriorating relations between the new regime in Niamey and several Western powers, as well as the West African bloc Ecowas. Nigeria currently holds the presidency of Ecowas.Paris has repeatedly backed calls by Ecowas for the reinstatement of president Mohamed Bazoum, who was overthrown on July 26.In separate letters to their respective governments, Niger's foreign ministry said the French, German, Nigerian and US envoys should leave the country within 48 hours.Each letter said it was in response to the refusal of the envoys to respond to an invitation from the ministry for a meeting Friday and other actions of their respective governments "contrary to the interests of Niger".On Friday evening, the French foreign ministry said: "The putschists do not have the authority to make this request, the ambassador's approval coming solely from the legitimate elected Nigerien authorities." France has 1,500 soldiers based in Niger who had been helping Bazoum in the fight against jihadist forces that have been active in the country for years, while the United States has around a thousand military personnel in the country.- Pressure from Ecowas - Earlier Friday, West Africa's bloc Ecowas urged Niger's coup leaders to reconsider their position and pushed for a return to civilian rule, with the threat of force still "very much on the table".While the generals who ousted Bazoum have called for a three-year transition period, the Economic Community of West African States demands the immediate return to constitutional order.With delegations shuttling into Niamey, Ecowas said negotiations remained its priority as defence chiefs prepared a standby mission for a possible "legitimate use of force" to restore democracy if needed."Even now, it is not too late for the military to reconsider its action and listen to the voice of reason as the regional leaders will not condone a coup d'etat," Ecowas commission president Omar Alieu Touray told reporters in Abuja."The real issue is the determination of the community to halt the spiral of coup d'etats in the region."Ecowas has already applied sanctions against Niger to pressure the new regime.The Niger coup has heightened tensions in the Sahel region, where three other governments have fallen to military rebellions since 2020, and jihadists control swathes of territory.Ecowas leaders are already negotiating with military administrations in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea who are all working towards transitions to democracy after their own coups.After initially balking, Niger's new rulers have said they remain open to negotiations.But they have sent mixed messages, including a threat to charge Bazoum -- who remains detained at the official residence with his family -- with treason.- Aggression - Niger's military leaders have also warned against any intervention, accusing Ecowas of preparing an occupying force in league with an unnamed foreign country.Niger on Thursday agreed with the regimes in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso to let their troops into its territory in case of an aggression.But Touray dismissed plans for Ecowas "declaring war" or an "invasion" of Niger, insisting the standby mission would be a legitimate force allowed under Ecowas statutes agreed by members."The instruments include the use of force. So it is very much on the table, as are other measures we are working on," he said."If peaceful means fail, Ecowas cannot just fold its hands."Ecowas has intervened militarily in past crises, including in civil wars. Few details of the new standby force have emerged.But preparations for any possible use of military force in Niger are risky and already face political resistance in northern Nigeria, a key player in Ecowas and the region.Niger's northern neighbour Algeria has also warned of disastrous consequences for the region from an intervention.Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf this week toured West African countries to try to find a solution to a crisis in which Algiers firmly opposes any military option."There is a time for everything and we are currently in the time of finding peaceful solutions," he said on a visit to Benin."Let's put all our imagination into giving every chance to a political solution.|https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103075981,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115658,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg

"Of course, in the West those speculations are put out under a certain angle... All of this is an absolute lie, and when covering this issue, it is necessary to base yourself on facts. There are not many facts yet..."Asked whether the Kremlin has received an official confirmation of Prigozhin's death, Peskov referenced Putin's remarks from a day earlier: "He said right now all necessary forensic analyses will be carried out. Once some kind of official conclusions are ready, they will be released."Sergei Mironov, leader of pro-Kremlin Fair Russia party, said on Telegram Prigozhin had "messed with too many people in Russia, Ukraine and the West... It now seems that, his number of enemies reached a critical point."

http://money.cnn.com/2018/11/01/retirement/irs-contributions/index.html?section=money_latest|Retirement contribution limits will rise in 2019|Good news retirement savers: The Internal Revenue Service announced cost of living increases to the contribution limits for retirement-related plans in 2019. Annual contribution limits to 401(k)s will increase to $19,000 from $18,500. And the annual contribution to an IRA, last increased in 2013, rises to $6,000 from $5,500. "This is another win for investors and savers," says Stephanie Bacak, a financial planner at Capstone Global Advisors. "For so long there were really no cost of living increases in the IRA so it is a great opportunity for so many to be more prepared for retirement." Catch-up contributions, available to those age 50 and over, will remain unchanged at $6,000 for 401(k)s and $1,000 for IRAs. In addition to 401(k)s, limits for 403(b)s, most 457 plans and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan will also increase to $19,000. Also rising next year are the income ranges that determine eligibility for deductible contributions to IRAs, to Roth IRAs, and to claim the saver's credit. For example, the income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA increased to $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000. The IRS increases are helpful, says Shane Mason, certified financial planner at Brooklyn FI, but only if you are able to make the maximum contribution. He says those who want to continue to max out their 401(k) should revisit their contributions to make sure they're putting in enough with each paycheck. Those that are paid semi-monthly (twice a month or 24 times a year) should be contributing $792 per paycheck and those paid biweekly (every two weeks or 26 times a year) should be contributing $731 per paycheck.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170419100856-retirement-gold-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/04/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html?section=money_topstories|7 things to know before the bell|1. The race to driverless cars: SoftBank SFTBF Toyota TM SoftBank will own just over half of Monet, the new business, while Toyota will hold the rest. It's the latest in a series of driverless development partnerships announced by tech companies and carmakers. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, its tech-focused investment arm, had already committed $2.3 billion to General Motors' self-driving car unit GM Cruise. On Wednesday, Honda (HMC) and General Motors (GM) said they were teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles. BMW (BMWYY) has joined the board of Apollo, an autonomous driving project from Chinese internet firm Baidu (BIDU). 2. Facebook under investigation: The Irish Data Protection Commission has launched a formal probe into a Facebook (FB) hack that affected as many as 50 million accounts. The commission will investigate whether the company complied with its obligations under new European data protection laws that came into effect in May. Facebook said last week that it closed the loophole, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. Irish regulators are investigating because Facebook's international headquarters is in Dublin. There are still many unanswered questions about the hack: Who carried it out? And what were they trying to access? 3. Bonds sell-off: The yield on 10-year US Treasuries has spiked to the highest level in seven years following the release of positive economic data. US hiring data published Wednesday was stronger than expected, and momentum could continue Thursday if initial claims numbers add to the optimism. A strong US economy and the expectation of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are fueling the trend. "The underlying message is that the US economy isn't just in fine fettle, it's on fire," said Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale. 4. CNN means business: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward. This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind. 5. Global market overview: US stock futures were lower. European markets dropped in early trade following a negative trading session in Asia. The Shanghai Composite was closed for a holiday.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/04/technology/softbank-toyota-masa-son/index.html?section=money_topstories|SoftBank and Toyota want driverless cars to change the world|SoftBank and Toyota want to change the world of transportation through autonomous vehicles and other technologies. The high-profile Japanese companies are forming a joint venture called Monet to develop businesses that will use driverless-car technology to offer new services, such as mobile convenience stores and delivery vehicles in which food is prepared en route. SoftBank (SFTBF) will own just over half of Monet, while Toyota (TM) will hold the rest. The new company's name isn't a reference to Claude Monet, the famous French painter, but rather a shortened version of the words "mobility network." Toyota President Akio Toyoda and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son attended the announcement of the project Thursday in Tokyo, a rare joint appearance by the heads of two of Japan's biggest global companies. Toyota first approached SoftBank with the idea of creating a Japanese alliance to try to catch up with global rivals that are developing autonomous driving tech. Around the world, top carmakers and tech companies like Google's parent, Alphabet (GOOGL), and China's Baidu (BIDU) are pouring resources into self-driving vehicles. Driverless vehicles have the potential to cause huge disruption in the auto industry and are also likely to transform the ride-hailing business. Son, SoftBank's billionaire founder, presides over a sprawling empire of artificial intelligence companies, internet businesses and ride-hailing startups, which can collect huge amounts of data on traffic patterns, passengers' requests and other transportation trends. The new venture taps into SoftBank's advantages in tech and data, and Toyota's vehicle-manufacturing expertise. Its aims include developing ways to tackle problems created by Japan's rapidly aging society and shrinking workforce. Over the next decade, Monet plans to roll out services like self-driving buses that can drive the elderly to grocery stores, hospital shuttles where medical exams can be done on board, and mobile offices. It will focus initially on Japan with a view to expanding globally. SoftBank has already put money into autonomous driving. Its $100 billion tech-focused Vision Fund committed $2.3 billion to General Motors' self-driving car unit GM Cruise earlier this year. On Wednesday, another top Japanese company, Honda (HMC), said it would also invest $2.8 billion in GM Cruise. Toyota has started pumping resources into driverless cars. It set up a new company in March dedicated to the research and development of self-driving vehicles, with plans to invest $2.8 billion to develop a commercially viable autonomous car. Both SoftBank and Toyota have invested in or partnered with some of the world's biggest ride-hailing startups including Uber, China's Didi Chuxing and Singapore-based Grab. The new SoftBank-Toyota venture shows how relations between automakers and tech companies have shifted. Twenty years ago, Son approached Toyota with the idea of connecting the company's Japanese dealerships on the internet. But Toyoda turned him down. Back then, Son said, SoftBank was a small company reaching out to the "giant rock" of Toyota. Today, it's the carmaker that's asking him for help. -- CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/181004090933-01-toyota-softbank-1004-restricted-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/investing/aston-martin-ipo/index.html?section=money_topstories|Aston Martin falls 5% in London IPO|Aston Martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an IPO that values the British company at more than $5 billion. But its first day of trading in London got off to a rocky start. The favorite carmaker of fictional British secret service agent James Bond priced its shares at £19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion). The final listing price is 16% below the top of the range that Aston Martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as Italian rival Ferrari. Shares dipped nearly 5% in London trading. In going public, the British company is asking investors to overcome fears about US threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for Britain's planned exit from the European Union to disrupt supply chains and markets. Aston Martin, which has a history of bankruptcy filings, is now producing healthy profits. It sold more than 5,000 cars in 2017, its best performance in nine years. That generated record revenue of £876 million ($1.1 billion), an increase of nearly 50% over the previous year. Earnings for the first half of this year show that momentum has continued. Revenue was up 8% over the same period a year earlier, while profit increased 14%, according to the numbers that were published last month. Aston Martin has in recent years sought to capitalize on its high-end brand. But analysts at Bernstein see several potential problems. They argue the Aston Martin brand is not as strong as that of Ferrari (RACE), which is bolstered by decades of racing history and a slew of Formula 1 championships. The British automaker also has much tighter margins than its Italian rival and a worrying history of uneven sales. With money raised from the IPO earmarked for existing shareholders rather than investment in the company, Aston Martin executives could be pinning too much hope on the success of a planned SUV. "Given its current financials and apparently rather less robust demand, it's a big stretch for us to see how it can possibly match Ferrari's profitability," analysts at Bernstein wrote recently. "We can't see it getting anywhere close." Aston Martin's owners include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DDAIF), private equity firm Investindustrial and investors based in Kuwait.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/181003093346-01-aston-martin-lse-1003-restricted-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/news/companies/barnes-and-noble-sale/index.html?section=money_topstories|Barnes & Noble stock soars 20% as it explores a sale|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on October 3, 2018. New York CNN Business — Barnes & Noble stock jumped more than 20% after the board said it would consider a sale of the troubled company. The board said Wednesday it had appointed a special committee to review offers. One came from longtime Barnes & Noble chairman Len Riggio. He is the company’s largest shareholder, controlling close to 20%. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also disclosed that a shareholder it could not identify had rapidly built up a stake in the company. To block a hostile takeover, Barnes & Noble’s board of directors approved what’s known as a poison pill. The poison pill will kick in if the unidentified party accumulates 20% of the stock or more. At that point, shareholders will be allowed to buy Barnes & Noble’s stock at a 50% discount, diluting the value of the shares. The announcement comes shortly after another investor disclosed a stake of close to 7%, and said he had held talks with Riggio about buying the company. The board said Riggio would vote his shares in favor of any transaction recommended by the committee. A potential sale is just the latest twist in the saga of Barnes & Noble, which is looking to replace its fifth chief executive in as many years. The bookstore fired its most recent CEO, Demos Parneros, in early July, citing unspecified violations of company policy. Barnes & Noble later revealed that claims of sexual harassment and bullying led to Parneros’ termination. In August, Parneros sued his former employer in federal court for defamation and for firing him without cause. Barnes & Noble still has more 600 stores and 23,000 employees. Last quarter, same-store sales dropped 6.1% compared with a year ago. Sales have fallen at Barnes & Noble during each of the past four years. New tactics, such as smaller store formats and a kitchen concept, have struggled to win back shoppers. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in September that most of the stores “feel tired, are too large and too cluttered, and do not offer the consumer any compelling reason to visit and buy.” He believes Barnes & Noble will shutter more stores: “Barnes & Noble needs to slim down in order to survive.” Barnes & Noble’s problems come as local and independent bookstores are resurgent. The American Booksellers Association, a trade group, reported that the number of independent locations rose 6% last year to 2,470.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181003165900-barnes-and-noble-strategic-review.jpg?q=x_61,y_0,h_1347,w_2394,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/investing/markets-now-investing-defense/index.html?section=money_topstories|Why it’s time for investors to go on defense|CNN — It’s time for investors to start making safer bets. That’s what Howard Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, told CNNMoney editor-at-large Richard Quest on “Markets Now” on Wednesday. “Defense is more important than offense” right now, said Marks, the author of “Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side.” Investors should consider taking a stake in utilities, and decreasing their investments in more volatile tech stocks, he said. Defense is the name of the game for a few reasons. Though stocks have been soaring, Marks warned that we may be nearing the end of the bull cycle. “I’m not saying get out,” he said. “I think that being out of the market is pretty dangerous today, and I think it would be a mistake to raise cash.” But more reliable stocks can protect investors from big losses if the climate changes. Marks also pointed to the trade war with China as another reason for investors to tread carefully. “We have a trade battle with China, it’s probably going to get solved, but it may go off the rails,” he said. “And if it goes off the rails, it has very serious consequences for the world economy.” CNNMoney's "Markets Now" streams live from the NYSE every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/technology/california-net-neutrality-suit/index.html?section=money_topstories|The internet industry is suing California over its net neutrality law|The internet industry is suing the state of California over its days-old net neutrality law. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by major trade groups representing broadband companies, is the second major lawsuit filed against the state over the law — the first was brought by the Justice Department. On Sunday evening, California Governor Jerry Brown signed what is considered to be the strictest net neutrality law in the country. Under the law, internet service providers will not be allowed to block or slow specific types of content or applications, or charge apps or companies fees for faster access to customers. Hours later, the federal government filed a lawsuit in which it alleged that California was "attempting to subvert the Federal Government's deregulatory approach" to the internet. The DOJ argues states can't pass their own laws governing internet companies, because broadband services cross state lines. It is fighting the state over a clause in the 2017 order repealing Obama-era federal net neutrality protections. In that order, the FCC said it could pre-empt state-level net neutrality laws. The impending legal battle could drag on for many months if not longer, Daniel Lyons, an associate professor at Boston College Law School who specializes in telecommunications and Internet regulation, told CNN. A lot is riding on the outcome. The California law is considered the most thorough state-level net neutrality legislation yet passed, and other states are expected to use it as a blueprint for their own laws. If California wins in court, it would open the door for those other states to take similar actions. However, the FCC could try to come back with an order to block their efforts again, Lyons said. California will likely claim that the pre-emption provision is invalid, Lyons said, while the federal government will attempt to get an injunction to stop the law from taking effect. in doing so, it will claim that the law will cause harm if allowed to take effect. "These attempts at getting a preliminary injunction seem weak and are likely to fail for the same reasons that the Internet Service Provider [ISP] industry was unable to obtain a stay of the FCC's former net neutrality rules in 2015," said telecommunications attorney Pantelis Michalopoulos, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP who has argued net neutrality cases. "The Internet Service Providers offer speculative theories about why they will suffer irreparable injury. These theories do not appear to satisfy the test for a preliminary injunction." The industry groups taking part in the new lawsuit represent major companies including AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, as well as other cable companies and wireless providers across the US. The groups had previously lobbied against the state law. (CNN is owned by AT&T.) "We oppose California's action to regulate internet access because it threatens to negatively affect services for millions of consumers and harm new investment and economic growth. Republican and Democratic administrations, time and again, have embraced the notion that actions like this are preempted by federal law," the trade groups USTelecom, CTIA -- The Wireless Association, The Internet & Television Association, and the American Cable Association said in a statement. "We will continue our work to ensure Congress adopts bipartisan legislation to create a permanent framework for protecting the open internet that consumers expect and deserve." In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Attorney General Xavier Becerra indicated the state would fight to protect its new law. "This suit was brought by power brokers who have an obvious financial interest in maintaining their stronghold on the public's access to online content. California, the country's economic engine, has the right to exercise its sovereign powers under the Constitution and we will do everything we can to protect the right of our 40 million consumers to access information by defending a free and open Internet," Becerra said in a statement. State Senator Scott Wiener, a co-author of the bill, previously told CNN he expected the ISPs to sue over the law. "The internet service providers have every right to sue California, just like California has every right—indeed an obligation—to protect our residents' access to an open internet," Wiener said after the trade groups filed their suit.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/181003145709-net-neutrality-protest-2017-file-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/technology/bumble-india-priyanka-chopra/index.html?section=money_topstories|Bumble to expand to India with the help of actress Priyanka Chopra|New York CNN Business — Bumble is the latest online dating app to compete for the hearts of women in India. Bumble, which requires women to make the first move, announced Wednesday plans to launch in India later this year. Indian celebrity Priyanka Chopra, a new investor in the company, will advise on the expansion. The news comes less than a week after rival Tinder launched a My Move feature in India that gives women the option to prevent men from initiating a conversation. But Bumble’s efforts for an expansion in India have been in the works for awhile. Founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said the newly engaged Chopra first told her “Indian women needed Bumble” months ago. Chopra was among a group of high-profile women who helped Bumble kickoff its networking app, Bumble Bizz, in October 2017. “It was clear then we shared a passion for empowering young women on a global level,” Wolfe Herd told CNN in an e-mail. “From there we began architecting a plan to partner and launch Bumble in India.” Wolfe Herd said the challenge in entering the Indian market is “localizing the experience and attracting women” — an area in which Chopra will help. Chopra’s manager, Anjula Acharia, is also an investor and adviser. Acharia helped Chopra — who was already established in India — reach fame in the United States. But Acharia has a long history of crossover efforts. She was instrumental in introducing artists such as Britney Spears and Lady Gaga to India — a background that could translate to Acharia helping Bumble resonate with the local audience. Bumble’s local app will be in both Hindi and Hinglish — a hybrid between Hindi and English — and available on iOS and Android. It will also roll out new safety features before entering the region, which has a reputation for violence against women. In June, India was named the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman. Wolfe Herd said it will only require Indian women to provide the first initial of their name — no first or last names — and provide new ways to report “bad behavior” in the app. Bumble already has photo verification features and more than 4,000 content moderators who review photos and profiles. Before Bumble, Wolfe Herd was an early employee and exec at Tinder but left the company in 2014 after suing for sexual harassment and discrimination. The case was eventually settled. But tension between the two dating companies has become increasingly palpable as a result of very public litigation between the Bumble and Match Group, Tinder’s parent company. In March, Match Group targeted Bumble with a lawsuit accusing the company of patent infringement and stealing trade secrets. Bumble asked the court last week to dismiss the case. Separately, Bumble filed a counter lawsuit against Match Group. Bumble argues that Match Group is using litigation as revenge over failed acquisition talks. Both lawsuits are ongoing. While Bumble already operates in over 160 countries, India is a significant market because of its size. According to a report from Bain & Co, India has 390 million internet users, the second largest of any country behind China.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002113305-100218-priyanka-chopra-bumble-gfx.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3999,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/microsoft-surface-computers/index.html?section=money_topstories|Microsoft unveils new Surface devices, smart headphones|New York CNN Business — Fall is the season for new gadgets. Apple recently announced its latest iPhones, Amazon showed off new smart speakers and even an Alexa-activated microwave, and Google is hosting its own product launch event next week. But Tuesday is all about Microsoft, which unveiled a slew of devices ahead of the holiday shopping season. Its lineup includes a new version of its desktop computer, called the Surface Studio 2, and its first pair of smart headphones. It also announced the Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. The first Surface desktop, an iMac competitor focused on creativity, was introduced in October 2016. Its successor, the Surface Studio 2, offers improved graphics performance and Microsoft says it’s the fastest Surface device ever made. It has a 28-inch display and USB-C support. It’s available for pre-order on Tuesday starting at $3,499. The Surface Headphones ($349) offer adjustable noise cancellation and automatic pause and play, which will stop the video you’re viewing when you take them off. Microsoft’s voice assistant Cortana is built in and can read your emails aloud or start a conference call. Surface Headphones will be available later this year. Microsoft's new Surface Studio 2 is all about creativity. Microsoft Meanwhile, Microsoft says the Surface Pro 6 is 67% faster than its predecessor but with the same battery life (up to 13.5 hours). Microsoft also says it’s easy to toggle between laptop, studio and tablet mode. It comes in black and platinum and starts at $899. The Surface Headphones are Microsoft's first premium and smart headphones. Microsoft The original Surface Pro in 2012 was marketed as a tablet. It looked kind of like an iPad, but with the addition of a keyboard cover. Microsoft (MSFT) has since shifted its pitch to a laptop with a touchscreen. This 2-in-1 format is aimed at people like doctors, pilots and students who need tablets for note-taking or reading, but a laptop for full functionality. The Surface Pro 6 is faster than its predecessor. Microsoft The Surface Laptop 2 (starting at $999) comes with faster and quieter typing and up to 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. It’s 85% faster than its predecessor, and the Surface Laptop 2 comes in a new color (black), as well as the existing options burgundy, platinum and blue. The Surface Laptop 2 has faster and quieter typing. Microsoft “More and more, devices are permeating your whole life. We build these things to appeal for your work and personal life,” Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s corporate VP of modern life and devices, told CNN. The company also unveiled its next-generation Windows software – called Windows 10 October 2018 Update – which has a focus on productivity. For example, the Your Phone App brings texts and photos from your Android phone to your PC. (Apple allows such an integration for its iMessage service.) You can also integrate a To-Do list with Outlook.com, and drag an item into an open slot on your calendar to block time to finish it. Microsoft’s main audience for these new devices is enterprise business professionals, according to Andrew Hewitt, an analyst at research firm Forrester. Ahead of Tuesday’s event, he noted Microsoft has heavily invested in productivity elements including Timeline, which lets you go back to where you left off on files and websites, and Focus Assistant, a feature that limits distractions like notifications. “There is a sense that Microsoft is trying to compete with Apple on the creative front, with new capabilities for picture and movie editing,” Hewitt said. “But the other features are much more aligned with Microsoft’s mission to empower employees to be productive.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002131210-03-microsoft-surface-computers.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1500,w_2665,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/news/economy/employer-health-insurance-cost/index.html?section=money_topstories|Getting health insurance through work now costs nearly $20,000|Editor’s Note: This story originally published October 3, 2018 New York CNN Business — Employers and workers together are spending close to $20,000 for family health insurance coverage in 2018, according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation report. Although premiums have increased fairly modestly in recent years, the growth has far outpaced workers’ raises over time. The average family premium has increased 55% since 2008, twice as fast as workers’ wages and three times as fast as inflation, Kaiser’s Employer Health Benefits Survey found. Companies pick up most of the tab, shelling out $14,100 a year, on average. Still, workers have to pay an average of $5,550, up 65% from a decade ago. For single coverage, total premiums have reached $6,900, on average, up 47% from 2008. Workers contribute roughly $1,200 a year. Deductibles also continue to burn a deeper hole in workers’ pockets. The average deductible now stands at $1,350, up 212% since 2008. That’s eight times faster than wage growth. Also, more workers are subject to deductibles – some 85% in 2018, compared to 59% a decade ago. A quarter of all workers face deductibles of at least $2,000, up from 15% five years ago. Employers have sought to limit premium increases by raising deductibles instead. But large deductibles are among Americans’ main complaints about their health coverage. “As long as out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, drugs, surprise bills and more continue to outpace wage growth, people will be frustrated by their medical bills and see health costs as huge pocketbook and political issues,” said Drew Altman, Kaiser’s president. While employers have been trying to rein in health care costs for years, the issue has come into the spotlight once again. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced earlier this year that they were joining forces to give their combined 840,000 employees better health care choices and bring down costs, both for their workers and their companies. A growing number of companies are also contracting directly with hospitals and providers to take care of their workers, according to a National Business Group on Health study released in August. General Motors and Henry Ford Health System in Detroit recently set up such a contract. The six-hospital system will provide access to more than 3,000 primary care and specialty doctors, as well as hospital, emergency room and pharmacy services, to nearly 24,000 salaried GM workers and their families. Some employers are looking to limit their networks to certain high-quality providers, which allows them to lower costs. Some 11% of companies said they’ve implemented these performance-based networks, up from 3% in 2014, according to a survey released earlier this year by PwC, a consulting firm. Another 34% of firms said they were considering these networks. More large companies are offering coverage for telemedicine visits with providers, such as through videoconferencing or remote monitoring. The share skyrocketed to 74% this year, up from 27% in 2015, according to the Kaiser study. Employees, however, have yet to embrace the new technology. Only 0.51% of those in large employer plans had at least one telemedicine visit in 2016, the latest data available. “Lots of companies are paying for telemedicine, but very few employees are using it,” said Matthew Rae, senior health policy analyst at Kaiser.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002174105-employer-health-benefits.jpg?q=x_0,y_200,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/beth-ford-boss-files/index.html?section=money_topstories|Land O’Lakes CEO Beth Ford, from the cornfield to the C-suite|Beth Ford’s first job paid $2 an hour. Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job. “Back then, two dollars an hour, that was real money,” Ford tells CNN’s Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files. Now, as the first female CEO of Land O’Lakes — and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies — Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that “while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.” “She said, ‘Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don’t disappoint,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve gotta work hard to not disappoint,’” Ford says. Ford has a vision for Land O’Lakes. She wants to transform people’s perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it’s making in the ag-tech space. “My vision is to continue to invest in technology,” she says. “You have to have agility. E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there’s an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O’ Lakes is.” The future of Land O’Lakes In July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move China called the beginning of “the biggest trade war in economic history.” In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans. “Grain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs,” Ford says. “Export market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we’re seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment.” Ford says she’s spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics. “What I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft,” she says. “They want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they’re supportive.” More than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity — quickly. “Time is critical,” she says. “So then what’s the most important thing the administration can do? They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues.” Being a first When the announcement about Ford’s promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important “first” in Fortune 500 history. With Ford’s promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company. In the months since, she’s heard from people about how much that “first” has meant to them. “People have come up to me and said, ‘Thank you,’” she says. “And it’s not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, ‘Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.’” Ford says she’s never faced discrimination in her career, but she’s definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family. “I had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly,” she says. “I said, ‘The job looks great. You’re a wonderful leader. I can’t be here because I don’t think this will be great. My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter.” Thinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500, she says progress can’t be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases — something that she sees as “a shared responsibility” for management teams and their talent development programs. On that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: “Beth, if you want something, ask for it.” “You expect you’re going to be recognized because you’ve done the hard work, and that isn’t actually how it always happens,” Ford says.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001100059-beth-ford-land-olakes-ceo.jpg?q=x_208,y_75,h_867,w_1541,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/bitcoin-mining-ipo/index.html?section=money_topstories|Bitcoin mining IPOs are coming at a really tricky time|Bitcoin's big stock market debut is coming at a bad time. Three of the world's top makers of cryptocurrency technology are planning to sell shares, giving investors a new way to bet on digital currencies. They're reportedly hoping to raise billions of dollars. Unlike the dollar or the euro, which are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are based on computer code. Bitcoin, for example, is created and traded through the "mining" process in which computer algorithms solve increasingly complex math problems. Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, which are all based in China, make money by selling the high-tech parts and systems that power this mining. Together, they dominate the business. But the three companies operate in a young, unpredictable industry and are planning their IPOs in Hong Kong in brutal market conditions. The price of bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 in December, has since plunged by about two-thirds. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum have plummeted, too. "If the market price of cryptocurrencies suddenly falls ... demand for our mining hardware and cryptocurrency mining services will also drop rapidly," Bitmain warned potential investors this week. On top of that, Hong Kong's stock market, where the companies plan to list, entered a bear market this month, having plunged more than 20% from its previous peak because of concerns about China's economic slowdown and trade war with the United States. The mining technology companies haven't said when exactly they plan to go public or how much they're seeking to raise. Bitmain and Canaan declined interview requests, while Ebang didn't respond to a request. "These firms might be looking to cash out before the market takes an even steeper nosedive," said Benjamin Quinlan, founder of Hong Kong-based financial services consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. He points out that cryptocurrencies are slowly gaining more acceptance among mainstream investors despite recent setbacks, and that the three mining companies' revenues are still growing. But the industry faces major challenges. A key one is how governments go about regulating digital currencies. Last year, China banned most activities involving bitcoin. The country is still thought to be home to a significant number of cryptocurrency mining operations, but authorities have been trying to push them out. Cryptocurrency miners need huge amounts of electricity to run their rooms full of computing equipment around the clock. Some public utilities in the United States are already introducing higher tariffs specifically for miners. "Increasing the cost of bitcoin mining will decrease the demand for mining equipment, hindering the performance of these companies," Quinlan said. Mining cryptocurrencies is already less lucrative than it used to be. Bitcoin mining activity has exploded over the past year, boosting demand for the technology. But that means the profits from mining are spread more thinly across a greater number of users. That could hit future demand for mining equipment. Will the mining boom last? Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang were all profitable in their most recent financial year, according to documents setting out their intention to go public. But staying in the black will be a "massive challenge," said Leilei Wang, a Shanghai-based consultant at research firm Kapronasia. The companies are aware of the risks they face and are trying to adapt. For example, they say they are increasing investment in more advanced chip technology that can be used in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and connected devices. Although the Chinese government has a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in general, it's eager to bulk up the country's technological prowess in areas like computer chips. Chinese companies are still largely reliant on foreign chip technology, especially from the United States. "Whether [the cryptocurrency companies] are able to successfully pivot remains to be seen," Wang said. For now, their fate is tied to that of the wider industry. "Cryptocurrencies will likely fall out of favor" without greater mainstream adoption in the near future, Quinlan predicted. The mining equipment makers "will find it extremely difficult to survive when the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, withers away," he said. But bitcoin bulls are still hopeful that the currency can stage a recovery as financial exchanges and big companies start to take it more seriously. "As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up," Mike Novogratz, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNN this week.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927090807-01-bitcoin-illustration-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/25/news/companies/brands-china-consumer/index.html?section=money_topstories|From Apple to Coke, global brands are having a tougher time in China|Western brands are having to work harder to win over customers in China. Where American or European companies could once expect to find an enormous market hungry for their products, changing tastes and the challenge from new Chinese rivals are forcing them to adopt new strategies to succeed in the world's second biggest economy. The sterner challenge facing big names such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Apple (AAPL) has nothing to do with the trade war. At least, not yet. It's about new competition and increased wealth. "It doesn't work to just show up anymore," said Benjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at consulting firm China Market Research Group, referring to brands that are household names in the West. "Chinese consumer tastes are evolving rapidly." Coca-Cola (CCE) is one of the top companies that's having to adapt to this new reality. "We've seen a tremendous change in the consumption patterns," Curtis Ferguson, the company's China CEO, told CNN at last week's World Economic Forum in the Chinese city of Tianjin. Coke has launched more than 30 new drink brands in China in the past six months and now has about 275 in total, Ferguson said. They range from regular Coke to more exotic varieties with flavorings like yellow bean and apple fiber. Coke even has its own line of teas in China. That's a big change from the Atlanta-based company's previous approach of relying on the strength of its brand. The philosophy was "let them drink Coke," Ferguson said. He argued Western companies can't afford to treat their brands as sacrosanct. "Either you destroy your own brand in China, or someone else is going to do it for you," he said. Starbucks scrambles to keep up Starbucks learned the difficulties of shifting Chinese consumer habits the hard way. The coffee chain has about 3,000 stores in the country, making it one of its top markets. But in June, the company reported a sudden slowdown in growth in China, just weeks after it had announced plans for rapid expansion there. That's partly because it faces growing competition from an upstart local competitor. Luckin Coffee opened its first store in China less than a year ago. Now it has more than 500. Many of its customers order coffees online for delivery or takeout. Chinese consumers are also increasingly turning to delivery apps, like Meituan Dianping, for food or drinks. "Starbucks has always been slow adopting technology in China," Cavender said. Its customers "were tired of waiting in line to place orders." The global coffee giant is now trying to correct course. In August, it teamed up with Alibaba (BABA), China's largest e-commerce company, to launch delivery services. Automakers face 'big challenge' Global carmakers are also scrambling to keep pace with changes in China's auto market, the world's biggest. It's being shaken up by the rapid spread of electric vehicles, which have been promoted through government subsidies, resulting in a crowded market. Francois Provost, Asia-Pacific chairman of Renault (RNLSY), said the French carmaker is now fighting competition from both traditional rivals and new upstarts in China. Local player Nio (NIO), for example, sells an SUV in China that costs about half the price of Tesla's (TSLA) Model X. Sticker price is crucial in China, Provost said, as most customers are first-time buyers. But drivers are also demanding electric vehicles with longer battery life as networks of charging stations are still being built out across the country. "The big challenge is increasing the efficiency of the range and reducing user costs at the same time," Provost said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum. That will be tough for automakers, he predicts: "I can't honestly say we have full visibility on this." Apple's losing the innovation race Apple (AAPL) has lost market share in China to local rivals over the past two years. The iPhone accounts for less than 10% of smartphone sales in the country, analysts estimate. In the United States, it accounts for about 40%. Apple is facing fierce competition from Chinese players such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. "In recent years, Apple has slid quite a lot in the Chinese market," said Canalys researcher Mo Jia. "The very aggressive tech innovation from Chinese brands is changing the high-end landscape." The US company's latest models, the XS and XS Max, include features that could boost their appeal in the Chinese market, like dual SIM cards and a larger screen. But analysts are skeptical these will make much difference. "Apple is fighting a bit of a losing battle," Cavender said. -- Sherisse Pham and Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180919062416-02-coca-cola-china-file-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/facebook-hack-third-party/index.html?section=money_topstories|Facebook doesn't think hackers accessed third-party sites|Facebook says it has not found any evidence "so far" that its attackers accessed third-party sites through Facebook Login. It's a sliver of good news about a massive data breach that the company first disclosed last week. Attackers accessed as many as 50 million accounts in the largest such breach of Facebook's network. "We have now analyzed our logs for all third-party apps installed or logged during the attack we discovered last week. That investigation has so far found no evidence that the attackers accessed any apps using Facebook Login." said Facebook's Guy Rosen in a statement. On Friday, Facebook (FB) announced unknown attackers had exploited a vulnerability to access the accounts. They were able to view other people's Facebook profiles as if they were the accounts' owners. For example, they could see friends' profiles and updates. Facebook says it closed the loophole on Thursday night, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. The attackers stole Facebook "access tokens," which keep a person logged into their Facebook account over long periods. Facebook reset all 50 million tokens, as well as tokens for an additional 40 million people who had used the "view as" feature in the past year as a precautionary step. During a call about the hack last week, Rosen said the attackers would have also been able to access third-party sites using Facebook Login, but the company had found no evidence of them doing so. Hundreds of sites and apps including Tinder, Spotify and Airbnb use Facebook Login, which lets people access the services with their Facebook username and password. Early this week, developers were confused about whether their services had been exposed in the Facebook hack. The company says partners following Facebook "best practices" were automatically protected. Some developers might not have followed those rules, and they could have put their users at risk. "We're sorry that this attack happened — and we'll continue to update people as we find out more," Rosen said. -- CNN's Donie O'Sullivan contributed reporting.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180917175532-facebook-aclu-complaint-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/tesla-sales/index.html?section=money_topstories|Tesla calms fears with strong sales numbers|New York CNN Business — A tumultuous quarter at Tesla ended with some very good sales numbers. The company delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter, a strong performance that should calm investor fears about logistical problems and a looming cash crunch. That included almost 56,000 of the lower-priced Model 3. Production was a bit below that number: Tesla said it built about 53,000 Model 3s. But that was within the company’s projections. Only three months ago, the company struggled to build 5,000 Model 3s in a week, a long-delayed target. Tesla did not maintain that pace, but production was still high enough to keep the company on track to turn a sustained profit for the first time. Tesla was sorely in need of good news. In August, CEO Elon Musk proposed, then abandoned, plans to take the company private. The SEC sued Musk last week, claiming he had deceived investors by claiming in a tweet that he had secured financing to go private. On Saturday, the second to last day of the quarter, Musk reached a deal with the SEC to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as chairman of Tesla. He will remain as CEO, news that relieved Wall Street on Monday. Executives have also left the company in recent months, including the chief accounting officer, who quit after less than a month on the job. Tesla (TSLA) stock closed down about 3% following the production and sales report. Tesla will release revenue and profit numbers later in the quarter. The report did not give details on where those figures would come in. It did say that all Model 3s sold at the end of the quarter were the more expensive all-wheel-drive models, powered by dual electric motors. Musk also sent an email to all Tesla employees over the weekend saying that the company was close to its goal of being profitable. “We are very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong, but, to be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow (Sunday),” he wrote, referring to the last day of the quarter. “If we go all out tomorrow, we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations.” The company has reported only two quarters of modest profits in its 10-year history. It has reported a total of $6 billion in losses during that time. Tesla has $1.2 billion in debt maturing within the next six months, which has prompted some analysts to project the company would need to sell additional shares or debt to raise cash. Musk has said revenue from sales would give Tesla the cash it needs. But he also has admitted that the company has run into problems delivering its cars. That added to investor concerns about a cash crunch. Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2018 “Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell,” Musk tweeted two weeks ago to a customer who inquired when a promised car would be delivered. “This problem is far more tractable,” he added. “We’re making rapid progress.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002133235-01-tesla-model-3-1002-restricted.jpg?q=x_3,y_218,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/volkswagen-audi-rupert-stadler/index.html?section=money_topstories|Volkswagen dumps jailed Audi CEO amid emissions probe|London CNN — Volkswagen has severed ties with suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who has been jailed since June in connection with an emissions investigation. Stadler has left the board of management of Audi parent company Volkswagen (VLKAF) and stepped down as chairman of the premium brand’s management board, the autos group said in a statement Tuesday. “Due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense,” the statement said of Stadler. Munich prosecutors said in June that Stadler, who has worked for Volkswagen since 1990, had been detained because of concerns he could influence witnesses in an ongoing investigation. He is the highest ranking Volkswagen executive to be arrested in connection to a costly diesel emissions scandal that burst into public view in 2015. Volkswagen previously said that Stadler would be considered innocent until proven guilty. Audi tapped its top sales executive to lead the company after Stadler was detained. The German carmaker has admitted that it rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests. Diesel cars from Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary cheated on clean air rules with software that made emissions look less toxic than they actually were. The scandal sent its share price plunging, and trashed confidence among consumer and regulators in diesel technology. The episode has already cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in recalls, legal penalties and settlements. In a separate announcement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would offer incentives to customers in Germany who wanted to swap older diesel cars for cleaner models. Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive officer of Volkswagen, was indicted by US prosecutors in May. He was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud American customers and violate the Clean Air Act. Matthias Mueller, who was brought in to replace Winterkorn, stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by BMW (BMWYY) veteran Herbert Diess. Diess acknowledged at a press conference in April that Volkswagen had “lost a great deal of trust,” and that it would take years to restore public confidence in the automaker.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002113657-01-rupert-stadler-file.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/investing/general-electric-downgrade-debt/index.html?section=money_topstories|S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital|New York CNN Business — New General Electric boss Larry Culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he’s inheriting. Barely 24 hours after Culp became CEO, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of GE (GE) and GE Capital. Moody’s and Fitch warned they could do the same. All three ratings firms cited GE’s elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows – an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at GE’s power division. GE said on Monday that plunging profit at GE Power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018. S&P pointed to “deep near-term challenges” at GE Power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy. More recently, GE disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines. Culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider CEO in GE’s history. But at the top of the list must be repairing GE’s once-sturdy balance sheet. GE had a perfect AAA credit rating as recently as 2009. S&P lowered it on Tuesday from “A” to “BBB+”. Over the years, GE has piled on tons of debt caused by poorly-timed deals, a massive pension deficit and misguided share buybacks. Underscoring the scale of the problem, Moody’s said that GE’s “very elevated leverage” could lead it to downgrade the company’s rating by multiple notches. Ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money. The good news is that S&P updated its outlook on GE to “stable” because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years. Still, GE’s debt problems may force the company to reexamine its $4.2 billion dividend. GE cut the dividend last year for just the second time since the Great Depression. But GE’s finances have deteriorated further. S&P listed the dividend as one of several levers Culp could pull to reduce debt. In a statement, GE said it has a “sound liquidity position” that includes cash and operating credit lines. Repeating comments made by Culp on Monday, GE said it remains “committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging.” Now that he’s in charge, Culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former CEO John Flannery’s plans to break-up GE. Flannery’s turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division. Proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt. But shrinking GE also makes the company more dependent on the rest of its portfolio – with GE Power being the biggest remaining business. That means slumping power profit gives GE less firepower to pay down debt.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002143128-100218-ge-underwater.jpg?q=x_0,y_200,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800

http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/31/technology/security/tesla-hack/index.html?section=money_mostpopular|Tesla car doors can be hacked|Hackers can unlock a high-tech Tesla car door by using the same run-of-the-mill techniques they use to crack open computers. That's according to security researcher Nitesh Dhanjani, who spoke about his findings at a recent hacker conference in Singapore. All it takes is cracking a six-character password, considered low-hanging fruit in the cyber security world. And if it can happen to a Tesla (TSLA), other cars may also be susceptible. After all, many modern cars made by others like Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell phone networks. "We now have ways of accessing our cars we never did before, and consumers aren't quite aware of that. Hackers will try to take advantage of that lack of awareness," said Erik Cabetas, managing partner at the consulting firm Include Security. Dhanjani said today's cars should be held to a higher security standard than the average laptop. Not only are they more expensive, but losing control of a car can put lives in danger. "We can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home," Dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. "The implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level." Related story: Tesla and Audi to become AT&T cars Dhanjani was especially worried about Teslas. Tesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. A single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to Dhanjani. He also found that Tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. That opens up the site to what's known as "brute-force attacks," where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. On Monday afternoon, Tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, Dhanjani said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own Tesla Model S P85+ three weeks ago. He noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. It never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay. Related story: Tesla reaches deal to keep selling in New York Despite the findings, Dhanjani said he isn't uneasy about his own car and can't wait to get back from vacation to drive the Model S parked at home in Bellevue, Wa. However, he's concerned about the security of a Tesla, especially if it were to be the security standard for electric cars. "The time is right now for Tesla to fix this," Dhanjani said. "As other car manufacturers draw inspiration from Tesla's design and architecture, there will be more people to compromise and launch attacks against."|http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/favicon.ie9.ico
http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/01/real_estate/manhattan-home-prices/index.html?section=money_mostpopular|Manhattan home prices soar to median $972,000|While home prices in other parts of the country are still 20% below their housing boom peak, demand for large, luxury apartments has helped home prices in Manhattan almost fully recover from the housing bust. During the first quarter, the median sales price for a condo or co-op in Manhattan rose 18.5% year-over-year to $972,000, according to Douglas Elliman. That's more than four times the median U.S. home price of $205,000. Yet, in most parts of the country $972,000 will typically buy you a sprawling three or four-bedroom with a backyard and a garage. Buyers in Manhattan, however, are willing to shell out that amount for one bedrooms with less than 1,000 square feet of living space. Nevertheless, prices are expected to continue to climb. Manhattan's home sales are still below the $1.025 million peak set in the second quarter of 2008, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who calculates the market data for Elliman. But he believes, "we'll probably get there in the second quarter of 2014." Related: Hong Kong buyers send London real estate soaring Elliman, along with brokers Halstead Property and Corcoran Group, have all reported that sales volume in Manhattan was up 25% or more in the first quarter. And inventory still remains very tight, with homes often being snapped up in bidding wars. Miller said 38% of all sales were either at or above asking price and that has caused a big spike in prices. All three brokers reported that they saw high demand in luxury and high-end sales. With little new residential construction happening, there's not enough homes available to handle all of this buyer demand. Only 367 newly built apartments were sold during the quarter. Many were in ultra-luxury buildings catering to an international clientele of Chinese industrialists, Russian oil billionaires and other foreign tycoons. Also boosting prices: Families seeking large apartments of three bedrooms or more, said Diane Ramirez, the CEO of Halstead. "Manhattan was often for a segment of your life before you started a family or after you downsized in retirement," she said. "No longer. Now, it's where you want to raise your kids." Corcoran reported that 31% of new development closings during the first quarter were for units that had three bedrooms or more. Related: Million dollar housing markets Manhattan's housing shortage has sent many home seekers further afield to the outer boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island.

http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/31/pf/taxes/rand-paul-flat-tax/index.html?section=money_mostpopular|Rand Paul's hopes for a flat tax|When it comes to taxes, Rand Paul wants them simple and flat. The blunt-spoken, Libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky, who won the 2016 presidential straw poll among leading conservatives, favors a flat tax: a one-rate income tax system with a minimum of tax breaks for individuals and businesses. But Paul hasn't settled on what that rate should be. He has publicly discussed 17%. An aide said if Paul does make a formal proposal, the rate would not be higher than 17% and could be lower. Much would depend on which tax breaks Paul chooses to keep. Two would definitely remain: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. But both would be considerably larger than they are under today's code. The Paul aide said the senator might also consider preserving in some form the tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Paul hasn't ruled out other types of tax reform if they "eliminate" complexity and regulation. But he has sketched out his views on a flat tax over the past few years. "What you'd have is an attrition if not an outright elimination of the IRS because it would be so simple that people would comply, and it would be very simple to know whether they complied or not," Paul told Fox News last year. Under a Paul flat tax, an individual would owe taxes on his wages, salaries and pension payments. But fringe benefits at work would remain tax free to workers, as they are today. One example of that is the contribution employers make to pay for workers' health insurance. Capital gains, dividends and interest would also be tax free at the individual level, but would be taxed at the business level. Capital gains on owner-occupied housing would also be tax free. In addition, Paul would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. Related: Paul takes step toward White House run Could a flat tax no higher than 17% raise as much revenue as the current system? No. To do that you'd need to have a rate at least in the low- to mid-20% range, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate of the Tax Policy Center. But raising the same amount of revenue isn't Paul's goal. On the contrary, Paul favors tax reform that would raise less revenue than today's tax code is projected to. At the same time, he wants to eliminate deficits within five years and proposes to do so in large part by reducing spending (as a percent of the size of the economy) every year over a decade. Paul asserts that his flat tax would be progressive since the net percentage of one's wages paid in taxes would rise along with income. Here's a simplified example of what that means: Say a married couple with two kids makes $100,000 in wages and is allowed to exempt $35,000 for their standard deduction and $6,500 for each dependent. Their total exemption would be $48,000. So they would pay 17% on the remaining $52,000 of their income, or $8,840 in federal income taxes. That represents 8.84% of their gross income, which is their net effective tax rate. If the same couple made $200,000 in wages, they would owe $25,840 in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12.92%. But the overall effective rate could be lower still for high-income households because they are more likely to have investment income, which would be tax free under Paul's guidelines. Related: Republican tax reform plan unveiled And, Rosenberg noted, the 15.3% payroll tax -- which is money that workers and their employers pay into Social Security and Medicare -- would still be the biggest tax bite for low-income households. A pure flat tax system wouldn't alter the payroll tax, although it's not clear whether Paul would like to. Ideally, he would prefer a flat tax in which no one pays more than they currently do. But he has implied, and his aide confirmed, that if the effective rates of the very wealthy go up to ensure that the income tax burdens on lower and middle-income families don't increase, he would be okay with that. Unless he puts out a detailed flat-tax proposal, however, it's impossible to say definitively who would be helped or hurt by the changes. Of course, if Paul decides to run for president in 2016, he would hardly be the first Republican candidate to call for a flat tax. Steve Forbes ran on a 17% flat tax in 2000. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich ran on an optional flat tax in 2012. Their rival Herman Cain proposed a flat-ish tax called 9-9-9. And there have been plenty of flat-tax proposals introduced in Congress over the years. It's not at all clear when Congress will take up the issue of tax reform seriously, or if a flat tax of some kind would ever garner sufficient support. Many believe not much will happen to overhaul the tax code until the next president takes office in 2017. But should Paul make a run for the White House, you can expect to hear more about the flat tax over the next couple of years.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140327075518-rand-paul-flat-tax-proposal-1024x576.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/jcpenney-jill-soltau-ceo-joann/index.html?section=money_news_companies|JCPenney names Jill Soltau as its new CEO|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on October 2, 2018. New York CNN Business — Jill Soltau, a veteran retail leader most recently in charge of Joann fabric and craft stores, will be tasked with turning around JCPenney. The company announced on Tuesday that Soltau will take over as its chief executive beginning on October 15. JCPenney has been leaderless since Marvin Ellison left in May to take the top job at Lowe’s. Soltau, 51, will be the 25th woman currently leading a Fortune 500 company, according to Fortune magazine. She will become Penney’s fifth chief executive in the past decade. She will make a base salary of $1.4 million, with a $6 million signing bonus and will be eligible for annual performance-based bonuses. In a sign that Soltau has Wall Street’s approval to start, shares rose 10% in extended trading. Soltau will face a daunting task: turning around JCPenney (JCP), a former retail heavyweight that has fallen more than 50% this year and slipped to close to $1.50 a share. Penney is currently without its chief financial officer. Jeffrey Davis resigned last week only 14 months after taking the job. The challenges at JCPenney are enormous. It is more than $4 billion in debt and has posted a profit in only two quarters during the past four years. Penney lost $101 million in its most recent quarter. JCPenney’s decline comes at a moment when rival department stores Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl’s (KSS) and Macy’s (M) have demonstrated an ability to reinvent their businesses for the digital shopping era. Soltau will have to make tough decisions about Penney’s store footprint. The company has 860 stores and hundreds of them are in struggling malls. JCPenney also has a glut of clothing piling up at its warehouses and stores. Penney has been searching for a leader with merchandising experience to help it make better decisions about which brands to sell in stores. “We wanted someone with rich apparel and merchandising experience and found Jill to be an ideal fit,” board director Paul Brown said in a news release. Soltau took over at Joann in 2015. She has also held positions at Shopko, Sears, and Kohl’s. Penney selecting Soltau signals the company wants to break from Ellison’s strategy. Ellison was a former Home Depot executive and led Penney into the appliance business.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/investing/general-electric-downgrade-debt/index.html?section=money_news_companies|S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital|New York CNN Business — New General Electric boss Larry Culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he’s inheriting. Barely 24 hours after Culp became CEO, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of GE (GE) and GE Capital. Moody’s and Fitch warned they could do the same. All three ratings firms cited GE’s elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows – an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at GE’s power division. GE said on Monday that plunging profit at GE Power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018. S&P pointed to “deep near-term challenges” at GE Power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy. More recently, GE disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines. Culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider CEO in GE’s history. But at the top of the list must be repairing GE’s once-sturdy balance sheet. GE had a perfect AAA credit rating as recently as 2009. S&P lowered it on Tuesday from “A” to “BBB+”. Over the years, GE has piled on tons of debt caused by poorly-timed deals, a massive pension deficit and misguided share buybacks. Underscoring the scale of the problem, Moody’s said that GE’s “very elevated leverage” could lead it to downgrade the company’s rating by multiple notches. Ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money. The good news is that S&P updated its outlook on GE to “stable” because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years. Still, GE’s debt problems may force the company to reexamine its $4.2 billion dividend. GE cut the dividend last year for just the second time since the Great Depression. But GE’s finances have deteriorated further. S&P listed the dividend as one of several levers Culp could pull to reduce debt. In a statement, GE said it has a “sound liquidity position” that includes cash and operating credit lines. Repeating comments made by Culp on Monday, GE said it remains “committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging.” Now that he’s in charge, Culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former CEO John Flannery’s plans to break-up GE. Flannery’s turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division. Proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt. But shrinking GE also makes the company more dependent on the rest of its portfolio – with GE Power being the biggest remaining business. That means slumping power profit gives GE less firepower to pay down debt.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002143128-100218-ge-underwater.jpg?q=x_0,y_200,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/goldman-sachs-kevin-hassett-trump/index.html?section=money_news_companies|Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says|New York CNN Business — Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. The Goldman Sachs economics team “almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition,” Hassett told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Tuesday. The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019. Hassett said he hadn’t read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman’s track record. Hassett claimed its analysis of last year’s tax cuts was “really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way.” He said Goldman’s analysis predicted the tax cuts would be “really harmful” to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed. “So maybe they’re just trying to make a partisan point before the elections,” said Hassett, chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Keep in mind that Goldman Sachs (GS), like other investment banks, charges clients to access their economic and market insights. Investors rely on that research to be nonpartisan. Goldman Sachs declined to comment about the criticism. It marks another chapter in Team Trump’s love-hate relationship with Goldman Sachs, the most powerful firm on Wall Street. Trump blasted Goldman Sachs during the 2016 presidential campaign. He claimed Goldman Sachs had “total, total control” over his rivals Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. Trump’s closing campaign ad flashed an image of Lloyd Blankfein, then the CEO of Goldman Sachs, as the candidate’s narration condemned the “global power structure” for robbing America’s working class. After the election, Trump reversed course. He named former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin to the powerful role of Treasury secretary. Trump hired Gary Cohn, a registered Democrat who was then president of Goldman Sachs, to be the face of his economic team. (Cohn left earlier this year because of a disagreement over trade.) In the 2016 race, Clinton received $388,426 from individuals at Goldman Sachs, more than any other candidate, according to OpenSecrets. Trump received $5,607, according to OpenSecrets. Then again, Goldman Sachs employees contributed more to Republicans than Democrats overall in 2016 federal races. Blankfein backed Clinton in the election. However, after the election, Blankfein gave Trump credit for the soaring American economy. “If the president didn’t win, and Hillary Clinton won … I bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be,” Blankfein told CNN in February. Veterans of Goldman Sachs have gone on to work in Republican and Democratic administrations. Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, served as Treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton. Hank Paulson had been the chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs before leading the Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush during the 2008 financial crisis.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002105430-100218-kevin-hassett.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/ge-ceo-larry-culp-flannery/index.html?section=money_news_companies|Meet GE’s new boss: Can Larry Culp right the ship?|New York CNN Business — General Electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create. Larry Culp, 55, is a proven leader known for his hands-on approach. He received a hero’s welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE’s new boss. GE’s (GE) beaten-down share price spiked 10%. Culp, who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just 37, faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness. The iconic maker of light bulbs, MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals, needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt. Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE’s market value over the past 18 years. That’s roughly the size of Facebook (FB). GE, a company that prides itself on management excellence, is so desperate that for the first time in its 126-year history it is being led by an outsider. “GE has been like watching a slow (but fatal) train wreck,” Scott Davis, lead analyst at Melius Research, wrote to clients on Monday. “Unwinding 15 years of bad decisions will require courage,” but Davis added: “I wouldn’t want to bet against Larry.” Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood, GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery, a 30-year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp. “GE should be commended for selecting a credible, seasoned GE outsider,” Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients. Culp is likely to “more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be.” Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between 2001 and 2015. The company’s revenue and market cap quintupled over that time. It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited.” Jeff Sonnenfeld, Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses. He pushed Danaher into health care, a business that today sells tools, lights and software used by dentists. “He’s got the chops to take over a company of this size,” said Jim Corridore, an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research. ‘Disturbing’ writedown Khanna cheered Culp’s history of “prudent” capital allocation at Danaher, noting that roughly $25 billion was deployed during his tenure. After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt, GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources. Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low. Consider the disastrous 2015 purchase of Alstom, a $9.5 billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time. GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to $23 billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired. “The size of the writedown is disturbing,” said Corridore. Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year. While he deserves credited for disclosing “dirty laundry” he uncovered, Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders. “It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited,” said Jeff Sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management. In a statement, Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent. “Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors. His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE’s needs,” Immelt said. Will GE continue its makeover? Now, Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery’s turnaround plan. Culp joined GE’s board in April, meaning he signed off on Flannery’s push to remake the company around power, its booming aviation business and renewable energy. The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care, railroad, light bulb and oil-and-gas businesses – and use the proceeds to pay down debt. Given Culp’s history in health care at Danaher, Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division. GE’s vast corporate structure, built up over decades by Immelt and Welch, could get slimmed-down under Culp. Culp ran Danaher with less than 100 employees in the corporate office, and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely “strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms.” Tall challenge ahead But cost-cutting alone won’t fix GE. Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power. Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy, but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems. GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates. And then there’s the ghost of GE Capital, the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis. Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines, such as WMC Mortgage, the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department. Elsewhere at GE Capital, Culp needs to stabilize the long-term care insurance portfolio that suffered a $6 billion loss in January. The news prompted an SEC investigation – the second GE is currently facing. By hiring Culp, GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street. But don’t be fooled: righting the ship will take much longer.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001141200-100118-lary-culp-ge-ceo-gfx.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/beth-ford-boss-files/index.html?section=money_news_companies|Land O’Lakes CEO Beth Ford, from the cornfield to the C-suite|Beth Ford’s first job paid $2 an hour. Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job. “Back then, two dollars an hour, that was real money,” Ford tells CNN’s Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files. Now, as the first female CEO of Land O’Lakes — and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies — Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that “while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.” “She said, ‘Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don’t disappoint,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve gotta work hard to not disappoint,’” Ford says. Ford has a vision for Land O’Lakes. She wants to transform people’s perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it’s making in the ag-tech space. “My vision is to continue to invest in technology,” she says. “You have to have agility. E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there’s an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O’ Lakes is.” The future of Land O’Lakes In July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move China called the beginning of “the biggest trade war in economic history.” In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans. “Grain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs,” Ford says. “Export market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we’re seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment.” Ford says she’s spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics. “What I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft,” she says. “They want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they’re supportive.” More than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity — quickly. “Time is critical,” she says. “So then what’s the most important thing the administration can do? They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues.” Being a first When the announcement about Ford’s promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important “first” in Fortune 500 history. With Ford’s promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company. In the months since, she’s heard from people about how much that “first” has meant to them. “People have come up to me and said, ‘Thank you,’” she says. “And it’s not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, ‘Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.’” Ford says she’s never faced discrimination in her career, but she’s definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family. “I had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly,” she says. “I said, ‘The job looks great. You’re a wonderful leader. I can’t be here because I don’t think this will be great. My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter.” Thinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500, she says progress can’t be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases — something that she sees as “a shared responsibility” for management teams and their talent development programs. On that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: “Beth, if you want something, ask for it.” “You expect you’re going to be recognized because you’ve done the hard work, and that isn’t actually how it always happens,” Ford says.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001100059-beth-ford-land-olakes-ceo.jpg?q=x_208,y_75,h_867,w_1541,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/general-electric-ceo-flannery-culp/index.html?section=money_news_companies|GE unexpectedly removes its CEO|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on September 30, 2018. New York CNN Business — General Electric, mired in a deep slump, has ousted CEO John Flannery after barely a year on the job. Flannery was replaced on Monday by Larry Culp, a respected executive who becomes the first outsider to lead GE in the company’s 126-year history. Culp, the former CEO of industrial manufacturing company Danaher, joined the GE board in February. GE (GE) has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that predate Flannery’s tenure as CEO. Flannery launched a turnaround plan this year that would narrowly focus GE on aviation and power, but the makeover wasn’t fast enough to restore confidence among investors. As it announced the leadership changes, GE revealed more bleak financial news: The conglomerate warned that its 2018 profit will “fall short” of guidance because of “weaker performance” at its struggling power division. GE further warned it will take an impairment charge related to GE Power. The company said the charge, which is still being finalized, will likely total nearly $23 billion. “GE remains a fundamentally strong company with great businesses and tremendous talent. It is a privilege to be asked to lead this iconic company,” Culp said in a statement. “We will be working very hard in the coming weeks to drive superior execution, and we will move with urgency.” ‘Proven CEO’ The stock jumped 14% as Wall Street cheered the leadership change. Thomas Horton, the former CEO of American Airlines, was elevated to the role of lead director. “We hold Mr. Culp in the highest regard” given his “operational and strategic excellence” at Danaher, RBC analyst Deane Dray recently wrote to clients. Scott Davis, lead analyst at Melius Research, hailed Culp as a “proven CEO with pedigree and the support of Wall Street.” Culp, 55, is credited with leading a turnaround at Danaher (DHR), which makes everything from dental tools to consumer packaging. GE said that during Culp’s 14-year tenure, Danaher’s sales increased fivefold and the stock price raced ahead of the S&P 500. In other words, exactly the opposite of the situation at GE. Despite the strong economy and booming stock market, GE’s stock price has crashed by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016. Longtime CEO Jeff Immelt was replaced by Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran, in August 2017. To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, Flannery announced plans to sell many of GE’s businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison’s light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes (BHGE) and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines. Power nightmare GE’s shares fell nearly one-third this year as investors worried about the company’s mounting debt and shrinking profit. “Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered,” CRA Research analyst Jim Corridore wrote to clients. The sell-off accelerated last month after GE said that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants. The turbine trouble could tarnish GE Power’s reputation and hurt sales at a time it’s strapped for cash. Under Immelt, GE made a big M&A splash by acquiring Alstom’s power business for $9.5 billion. The 2015 deal, GE’s biggest-ever industrial purchase, pushed the company further into fossil fuels just as renewable energy began stealing market share. GE, an original member of the Dow since 1896, was booted from the exclusive index over the summer. Last week GE’s market value fell below $100 billion for the first time since March 2009. As recently as 2004, GE was the most valuable company in America, worth nearly $400 billion. Culp faces serious challenges as he tries to restore GE to greatness. Beyond its power disaster, GE is grappling with a dual-pronged SEC investigation into its accounting practices and insurance business. And GE still owns a huge financial arm that it is trying to shrink. Part of that business, the subprime mortgage unit, is under investigation by the Justice Department. GE could put it into bankruptcy. GE, like many multinational companies, is also navigating the US-China trade war. Analysts warn that GE’s financial problems could force the company to cut its dividend again. GE halved the dividend late last year for just the second time since the Great Depression.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001090154-john-flannery-ge.jpg?q=x_0,y_140,h_1519,w_2700,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/investing/stocks-week-ahead-tesla-elon-musk/index.html?section=money_news_companies|The next big test for Elon Musk arrives this week|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on September 30, 2018. New York CNN Business — 1. Back to business: The SEC is off Elon Musk’s back. Now he and Tesla can return to that other pesky problem — making and selling cars. Tesla will turn in a critical production report on Tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week. That report will go a long way toward determining whether Tesla (TSLA) can fulfill Musk’s pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters. Since it went public, Tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black. It posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of June. That seems like a long time ago. In early August, Musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators — a cryptic announcement that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC said he had no such thing, and sued Musk last week for misleading investors. Under a settlement announced Saturday, Musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines. Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement. The SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up. A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs. That’s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt. The markets have reflected investors’ worry. Tesla bonds maturing in August 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, close to a record low. And Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet. The stock may bounce back Monday, now that the uncertainty over Musk’s future is removed. But Wall Street still wants something else — results. 2. Jobs, jobs, jobs: Analysts expect another month of solid growth when the US Labor Department issues its September jobs report on Friday. More important may be the wage growth figure: Will it hit 3% for the first time since April 2009? If so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive Federal Reserve? 3. Changing of the guard at Goldman: Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday. He will be replaced by Goldman president — and part-time DJ — David Solomon. The investment firm’s stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year. Solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from Goldman’s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies. 4. Earnings watch: It’s a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi (PEP), Stitch Fix, Bon-Ton and Costco. For Pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under CEO Indra Nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company’s global operations chief, Ramon Laguarta. The stock could use a caffeine boost: It’s down 7% this year. 5. Rebooting business news: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward. This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind. 6. Coming this week: Monday — Stitch Fix and Wage Works earnings; David Solomon becomes Goldman Sachs CEO; Eurozone unemployment rate Tuesday — PepsiCo earnings; US auto sales for September Wednesday — Lennar earnings; ADP employment report Thursday — Costco (COST) earnings; CNN Business launches Friday — US jobs report|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180928125330-elon-musk-sec-gfx.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/investing/stocks-markets-third-quarter/index.html?section=money_news_companies|The S&P 500 just had its best quarter since 2013|The longest bull market in history shows no signs of letting up. The S&P 500 soared more than 7% in the third quarter, which ended on Friday. That's the strongest quarter for the broad index since the end of 2013. The Dow spiked more than 2,100 points, or 9%. All three major indexes are near record highs. The surge represents a powerful rebound from Wall Street's brush with disaster in late January and February. Fears about inflation and tariffs have faded. Investors have shifted their focus to the strong economy and blockbuster corporate profits. Not even an escalating trade war between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, derailed stocks. "This time six months ago most expected the trade issues to slow down the economy, but that simply didn't happen," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. The US economy grew at a brisk 4.2% pace in the second quarter. That's the fastest pace in nearly four years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting third-quarter growth of 3.8%, although that's down from its prior estimate of 4.4%. The sturdy economy, along with corporate tax cuts, has sparked fantastic growth for Corporate America's bottom line. After spiking during the first half of the year, S&P 500 earnings are expected to leap another 19% in the third quarter, according to FactSet. The strong third quarter on Wall Street could be a good omen for the rest of the year. When the S&P 500 rises in the third quarter, it has advanced an average of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of all years since 1945, according to Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. In midterm election years, the S&P 500 rallies an average of 7.1% in the fourth quarter following a third-quarter gain. The fourth quarter of a midterm year is typically one of the strongest quarters out of the four-year presidential cycle, according to LPL Research. "With earnings and the overall economy on firm footing, the calendar could be the bull's best friend," Detrick said. So what could cause renewed turbulence on Wall Street? Investors will be on guard for more turmoil out of emerging markets, especially Argentina and Turkey. And everyone is looking for clues about whether China's economy is withstanding the onslaught of tariffs. Wall Street is also keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's efforts to wean the economy and stock market off easy money. The Fed raised rates for a third time on Wednesday and signaled another rate hike is in the cards for December. The decision marked the end of an era for the central bank. Longstanding language describing rates as "accommodative" was removed, suggesting policy is no longer so easy that it's boosting growth. If inflation significantly heats up, the Fed could be forced to accelerate its rate increases to the point that it hurts the economy. Friday's jobs report could offer more evidence of strengthening wage growth, a major driver of inflation. "A policy mistake down the road (from the Fed) could put an end to this bull market," Detrick said. The bull market's biggest challenge could be dealing with a looming deceleration in profits as the impact of the tax cuts fades. S&P 500 earnings are projected to rise by 7.1% in the first quarter of 2019, according to FactSet. That's a healthy gain, but barely half the recent spike. "My most pressing concern," said Stovall, "is that a slowdown in earnings next year will cause investors to take profits now."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180816053005-gfx-market-surge-780x439.jpg

The SEC says the company knew that number was a fantasy. Walgreens' former CEO Greg Wasson and CFO Wade Miquelon were well aware that the pharmacy would miss that $9 billion target badly, the SEC alleged on Friday. Yet Walgreens' top brass repeatedly affirmed the number to investors in earnings calls throughout 2013 and 2014. Finally, in August 2014, two years after it first announced the Boots merger, Walgreens admitted it wouldn't meet its profit forecast. It drastically cut its 2016 adjusted operating profit target down to $7.2 billion, shocking investors. The stock dropped more than 14% when it announced the change. The SEC on Friday settled with Walgreens for misleading its investors. Walgreens agreed to pay a $34.5 million penalty. "Over multiple reporting periods, senior Walgreens executives misled investors about the company's public financial goal," said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement in a statement. "The penalty assessed against Walgreens is intended to punish and deter such conduct, which deprived investors of information necessary to make fully informed investment decisions." According to the SEC, Walgreens' (WBA) internal forecasts said management knew the risk of missing the 2016 projection had increased "significantly." In its settlement, Walgreens did not admit or deny the allegations. "The settlement does not involve any of Walgreens Boots Alliance's current officers or executives, nor does it allege that anyone acted intentionally or recklessly at any time," the company said in a release. Wasson and Miquelon each will pay a $160,000 penalty. Walgreens' stock was unchanged on the news.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928120122-walgreens-sec-settlement-780x439.jpg

Now its second in command is out too. Penney said Thursday that Jeffrey Davis, the company's chief financial officer, was resigning 14 months after taking the job. Jerry Murray, a top executive, will take over as the interim finance chief. Davis' departure marked another sign of trouble at JCPenney (JCP). The company's stock has slipped 45% this year, driven down by Marvin Ellison's exit to take the top job at Lowe's. Penney has not replaced Ellison yet. On Friday, shares fell 9% to around $1.60, a record low. "They're in a leaky boat that eventually will sink," Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at the Columbia Business School, told CNNMoney last month. "The prognosis for the future is not happiness." Penney is more than $4 billion in debt. The company has posted a profit in only two quarters over the past four years. In its most recent quarter, Penney lost $101 million and was forced to discount to clear a glut of clothing piling up in inventory. Penney lacks a clear vision to bring back shoppers, analysts say. Although it closed 141 stores last year and is closing eight more this year, it still has more than 860 left. Penney had switched its focus from older shoppers to younger, trendier ones. Now it is moving back toward middle-aged women, with brands like Liz Claiborne. Earlier this month, Penney introduced Artesia, a new women's chic brand for less than $30. Months before he left, Davis said Penney's core customers were women over 45. The company will give an update on its efforts to win those shoppers in early November when it reports quarterly earnings.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928114051-092818-jcpenny-shopper-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/news/companies/elon-musk-sec-tesla/index.html?section=money_news_companies|Here's what happens next after SEC lawsuit|Elon Musk is the heart and soul of Tesla. If the SEC gets its way, he could have to step down. The SEC filed a lawsuit on Thursday that accused Musk of making "false and misleading" statements about a plan to take Tesla private. The real shocker is the SEC wants a judge to bar Musk, the company's chairman and CEO, from serving as an officer or director of a public company. "This is a nuclear threat to force him to settle," said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School. The news rocked Wall Street. Tesla (TSLA) shares plummeted 12% on Friday. "Tesla without Elon Musk is worth some substantial fraction less," Coffee said. "The penalty really falls on Tesla shareholders. Who is going to run that company?" Musk defended himself, calling the SEC lawsuit an "unjustified action" that leaves him "deeply saddened and disappointed." The CEO said he has always taken action "in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors." How serious are the SEC's accusations? Very. The agency chose to charge Musk under Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. That's what the SEC uses to go after insider traders and market manipulators. "It's a very serious accusation," said Thomas Gorman, partner at Dorsey & Whitney and a former SEC staffer. Coffee said in theory a judge could issue Musk a "lifetime" ban, permanently preventing him from serving as a corporate officer or director. Although the SEC did not request a specific time frame, it typically settles for less than a lifetime ban. Martha Stewart's 2006 settlement with the SEC over insider trading barred her from serving as CEO or chief financial officer of any public company for five years. The SEC clearly wanted to use this extremely high-profile case to make a point: Corporate executives can't make statements with little regard to their accuracy. "The SEC has already accomplished their objective: To get the headlines. And boy, did they get it," said Randall LaSalle, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. What happens next? Typically, these matters are resolved in a settlement. It's unusual that the dispute wasn't resolved prior to the SEC's lawsuit. "Most defendants try to settle as quickly as possible. But Mr. Musk has never been the perfectly rational actor," Coffee said. Even though Musk may now want to settle, the litigation may linger for weeks or even months. That could pose problems for debt-riddled Tesla. The company says it has no need to raise money, but Tesla analysts believe the company will need to raise cash soon to pay down debt and invest in its business. Investors may balk at the idea of lending Tesla more money when its CEO is in limbo and top executives are hitting the exits. Charles Whitehead, a professor at Cornell Law School, said it's possible that Musk reaches a settlement that allows him to take a lesser role -- but remain at the company. "Why would the SEC want to harm the company more than the tweet itself?" Whitehead said. "That would be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927175000-elon-musk-silhouette-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/technology/blackberry-earnings-john-chen/index.html?section=money_news_companies|BlackBerry's comeback continues|BlackBerry's transformation from struggling smartphone company into a burgeoning leader in cybersecurity software and connected cars is on track. The company now generates more than 90% of its total revenue from software and services. And 81% of those sales are recurring. In other words, BlackBerry is no longer subject to the fickle tastes of consumers and has hitched its wagon to corporate customers. BlackBerry (BB) reported profits and sales Friday morning for its latest quarter that topped Wall Street's forecasts. The stock was up more than 15% in late morning trading on the news. CEO John Chen, speaking to CNN Friday, said the company's biggest successes this quarter were in the connected and autonomous car market, with revenue growth of about 30% for the business unit that includes the QNX software business for cars. Chen said BlackBerry is working hard to win more customers in the automotive market, pointing to a deal it announced in January with Chinese search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) to jointly develop self-driving cars. The company, under Chen, realized a few years ago that it was a losing battle making devices that generated razor-thin profit margins at a time when Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) dominate the smartphone race. That's why BlackBerry decided in 2016 to stop making its own phones and outsource the production of devices with the BlackBerry name on them to other manufacturers. Since then, BlackBerry has gone all-in on software. BlackBerry hoping for a new 'Spark' So what's next? Chen said he's hopeful that BlackBerry's new Spark security platform, which is kind of like instant messaging on steroids, can make a bigger presence in the health care market. Spark integrates video chat, texts and other forms of media. BlackBerry is targeting health to help the company expand beyond its core markets of transportation, governments and financial services companies. Investors are pleased with the turnaround too. BlackBerry's stock is up more than 60% since Chen took over nearly five years ago. That's solid, but it has lagged the performance of Apple as well as the Nasdaq. Still, Chen has cleaned up BlackBerry's balance sheet. The company now has $2.4 billion in cash and just $740 million in long-term debt. Rumors about BlackBerry going out of business are no longer running rampant the way they were before Chen joined. BlackBerry's board is happy with Chen's leadership as well. BlackBerry announced in March that it was extending Chen's contract through November 2023. That may also put to rest some of the rumors that Chen was only going to stick around long enough to sell BlackBerry to a larger rival.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928091528-01-john-chen-blackberry-file-restricted-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/elon-musk-sec/index.html?section=money_news_companies|SEC sues Elon Musk for his allegedly misleading tweets|Elon Musk has tweeted himself into serious trouble. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tesla's CEO on Thursday for making "false and misleading" statements to investors. It's asking a federal judge to prevent Musk from serving as an officer or a director of a public company, among other penalties. The complaint hinges on a tweet Musk sent on August 7 about taking Tesla private. "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420," Musk said. "Funding secured." The SEC said he had not actually secured the funding. "In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source," the SEC said in its complaint. That tweet, and subsequent tweets from Musk over the next three hours, caused "significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla's stock," as well as harm to investors, the SEC said. On the day of Musk's tweet, Tesla's stock shot up nearly 9%. It has declined substantially since then. Tesla's (TSLA) stock dropped more than 11% in after-hours trading Thursday. "This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed," Musk said in a statement. "I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way." Tesla and its board of directors said in a joint statement that they are "are fully confident in Elon, his integrity, and his leadership of the company." "Our focus remains on the continued ramp of Model 3 production and delivering for our customers, shareholders and employees," the statement said. Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said at a press conference Thursday that the agency is committed to holding people accountable despite "celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator." The complaint alleged that Musk rounded up the go-private price to $420 per share "because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture" and thought his girlfriend would find it funny. He was dating the musician Grimes. Musk did not consult with any board members, employees or outside advisers before he sent the tweets, according to the SEC. "This is serious. This is what you go after insider traders and market manipulators on," said Charles Whitehead, professor at Cornell Law School. "This is a serious allegation." Musk abandoned the plan to take Tesla private less than three weeks after he first tweeted about it. He later said his "funding secured" comment was based on talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, which he said had urged him to take the company private and offered to increase its investment in Tesla. Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018 The Justice Department is also investigating comments made by Musk, Tesla said last week. The company said it had received a voluntary request for documents and is cooperating. Tesla said it had not been subpoenaed. Shareholders have also filed lawsuits charging that Musk made the claim to manipulate the stock price. Musk has brought a string of bad headlines down on himself with erratic behavior. He has fired off tweets late at night and brushed off analysts on corporate earnings calls. He disparaged a man who was working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand, and sparred with journalists and investors he believed were unfair to him. Musk vowed to launch a website called Pravda to critique the media. -- CNNMoney's Matt Egan and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180814155901-elon-musk-side-chicago-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/news/companies/cadillac-new-york-city-michigan/index.html?section=money_news_companies|Cadillac moving its headquarters back to Michigan|Cadillac is coming home to Michigan. Four years ago, GM announced it would move the headquarters for its luxury brand to the trendy SoHo neighborhood of New York City, and it set up the division as a "separate business unit." This week, GM said it will move the headquarters back to suburban Detroit near GM's technical center where much of the company's vehicle design and engineering is done. The move was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cadillac will remain a separate business unit, said GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey. He said Cadillac has a more aggressive plan for new vehicle introductions and will make a greater push to bring electric cars and self-driving vehicles to the luxury segment. So it made sense to bring the Cadillac marketing and executive staff that had been in New York closer to the design team in Michigan. About 110 Cadillac employees work in New York and all will be offered a job at the new headquarters in Michigan, Morrissey said. GM anticipates roughly the same headcount in the new headquarters as is now based in New York, though it is possible some open positions will be eliminated. At the time the move to New York was announced, GM said it would allow Cadillac to "reinstate the brand to a pre-eminent position among global luxury brands, a bold challenge requiring a distinct and focused new organization." And it wanted to aim that brand at the money and glitz of Manhattan, noting New Yorkers' "premium lifestyle." GM (GM) said it will keep open the Cadillac House, a public space for events, concerts and art shows that is part of the brand's New York headquarters. Johan de Nysschen had joined the company as president of Cadillac a month before the move to New York was announced, after a career at foreign luxury brands such as Infiniti and Audi. But he left the company in April. He was replaced by Steve Carlisle, most recently head of GM Canada, and a lifetime GM employee who joined the company when he was still a student 36 years ago. He's had postings around the globe during his GM career. Cadillac's US sales and share of the luxury market declined since it moved to New York. But global Cadillac sales have fared much better, rising 45% over the same period. About 60% of Cadillacs are now sold outside of the United States, compared to less than 40% only three years ago.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927104440-092718-cadillac-nyc-780x439.jpg

Stock at 18-year low|Bed Bath & Beyond is calling for backup. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it was bringing on two top management consulting firms to help it cut costs and improve its merchandise. CEO Steven Temares did not name the firms. The housewares retailer needs help. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) plunged nearly 25% Thursday to their lowest level since March 2000 because of awful sales during the previous quarter. Customers have been avoiding its brick and mortar stores, and heading instead to Target (TGT) and TJX (TJX)-owned HomeGoods. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, noted in a report Wednesday that overall "spending on homewares and home-related products has been strong." With that in mind, he said Bed Bath & Beyond's numbers "are little short of terrible." "The blunt truth is that Bed Bath & Beyond simply hasn't been up to the job of converting the momentum seen elsewhere in retail," Saunders wrote. Bed Bath & Beyond CFO Robyn D'Elia did say during the conference call that the company was gaining momentum online. She referred to an analyst's estimate that Bed Bath & Beyond was getting 10% of its sales from digital as "a little light." But GlobalData Retail's Saunders said that the company needs to do even more online, citing competition from Wayfair (W) and Amazon (AMZN), which he dubbed "savvy operators." "Trading online is far from easy. The bottom line is that we do not think Bed Bath & Beyond stands out here, and it needs to in order to thrive."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180418093909-bed-bath-beyond-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/news/companies/ge-stock-market-value/index.html?section=money_news_companies|GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession|General Electric, once America's most valuable company, is now in sharp decline. In a year full of dubious landmarks, GE has encountered another: The storied conglomerate is now worth less than $100 billion. That hasn't happened since March 2009 -- during the Great Recession. GE's (GE) stock crash -- down by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016 -- has knocked the company down to the 59th most valuable in the S&P 500. It's a stunning reversal. GE was No. 1 in the S&P 500 as recently as 2004, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. At the time, it was worth nearly $400 billion. Now GE is worth just a tenth of Apple (AAPL), the $1 trillion top dog of the market, and it's fallen behind Salesforce (CRM), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA). GE's struggles got it kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this summer. GE was an original member of the exclusive index in 1896 and had been in it continuously for 110 years. Plunging profits and mounting debt have driven GE's shares down by 35% this year. Only four S&P 500 companies have had a worse 2018. The most remarkable part about GE's decline is it comes at a time when the American economy and stock market are soaring. Rival industrial companies including Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming. But GE has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that have finally come home to roost. To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, GE is selling off countless businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison's light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines. Selling in GE's stock has accelerated in recent days because of worries about GE Power, the most troubled part of the slumping conglomerate. GE confirmed last week that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants. The turbine trouble could hurt the company's reputation and sales at a time when it's already strapped for cash. In a statement, GE said that it has "identified a fix" and has been working with customers to "quickly return units to service." JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr, Wall Street's biggest GE bear, told clients the turbine failure "raises red flags" about GE Power. Others think that shareholders are overreacting. Most likely, GE's "fundamental technology is sound" and repair costs will be "manageable," Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin wrote to clients.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926101913-02-general-electric-power-plant-780x439.jpg

Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, pledged earlier this year to donate the proceeds from the IPO of SurveyMonkey's parent company, SVMK. SurveyMonkey (SVMK) shares opened for trading at $18.75 -- a 56% increase over the IPO price -- and quickly rose as high as $20. At that price, Sandberg's stake in the company was worth more than $206 million. Sandberg joined SVMK's board after her husband Dave Goldberg, who ran the company, unexpectedly died while on vacation in 2015. She owns 10.3 million shares, a 9.9% stake in SurveyMonkey. She plans to donate the shares (or the proceeds from a sale of the stock) to the Sheryl Sandberg and Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. The donation is part of Sandberg's commitment to the Giving Pledge, the charitable campaign founded by billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. Representatives from SurveyMonkey, Facebook (FB) and Sandberg's LeanIn.Org nonprofit group were not immediately available to comment about whether Sandberg sold her shares and would donate proceeds from the sale or gift the stock. SurveyMonkey has several other powerful backers. Tennis superstar Serena Williams and Intuit (INTU) CEO Brad Smith also serve on the board and are investors in the company.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926100246-01-sandberg-goldberg-file-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/investing/september-stocks/index.html?section=money_news_companies|So much for September being awful for stocks|September is historically the worst month for stocks. And you've probably read your fair share of stories about the darkest September of all — the financial meltdown in 2008. But if you sat out the market this month, you missed a decent rally. With trading for September set to end on Friday, the Dow is up nearly 600 points, a jump of more than 2%. The S&P 500 has notched a small increase as well. Both indexes are near all-time highs. The Nasdaq is down in September. So is the Russell 2000 (RUT), a collection of smaller US stocks. But many blue chip stocks have enjoyed solid pops. Chipmaker AMD (AMD) — by far the best performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, with a gain of more than 200% — has surged more than 25% this month alone. Dow components Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), two stocks that do really well when the broader economy is humming, are up 6% and 10% respectively — despite worries about a trade war with China. And Exxon Mobil (XOM) has surged 7% as oil prices have rebounded. Several consumer stocks have also sported solid September gains, yet another sign that Americans are feeling confident enough to spend more. Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Hasbro (HAS), Starbucks (SBUX), Walgreens (WBA), Lowe's (LOW) and Tiffany (TIF) are all up between 5% and 15% this month. It would appear that both investors and consumers are tuning out the noise in Washington and ignoring silly Wall Street axioms about the calendar. After all, it wasn't a good idea to sell in May and go away, either. Since the end of April and start of the supposedly sleepy summer months, the Dow is up 9% — a jump of more than 2,200 points.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927083544-092718-nyse-sunny-780x439.jpg

New Delhi CNN Business — Tinder is allowing Indian women to really control the conversation. The dating app announced a new feature called My Move on Tuesday that gives women the option to prevent men from initiating a conversation — even if they’ve “matched.” The optional feature is currently only available to women using Apple’s iOS operating system in India, but it will soon be extended to Android users. “From user feedback, we have understood that while some women would prefer to exclusively make the first move, many other women do not want to feel like they have to — so we are giving them the ability to choose,” Tinder executive Taru Kapoor told CNN. Kapoor said that My Move is being tested in “select geographies” and will be made available in other countries in the coming months. She did not specify which markets will next get the feature. “Our aim is to continue to provide our users with a low-pressure environment where they feel in charge of the connections they make,” said Kapoor. The "Tinder" app logo is seen on a mobile phone screen on November 24, 2016. Leon Neal/Getty Images Giving women more control over interactions on the app is particularly relevant in India, where crimes against women have grabbed headlines and prompted outrage. Around 100 instances of sexual assault are reported to Indian police every day, according to figures from the National Crime Records Bureau. The data show there were 39,000 rapes in India in 2016 — a rate of roughly one every 13.5 minutes.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/mexico-trump-us-corn/index.html?section=money_news_international|Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers|Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn. Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States. It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country. "I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina," Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City. He added: It's a "good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes." American corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere. Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada. American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million. Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers. "If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy," says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm. Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%. Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true. Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan' Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like. All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period. But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA. Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond "immediately" to any tariffs from Trump. "It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature," Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show. --Shasta Darlington contributed reporting to this story|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170213111654-us-corn-field-nafta-780x439.jpg

That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity. "If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent," Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore. Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs. The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform. Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest. India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians. Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown. Related: Tech industry braces for Trump's visa reform Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through. "Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue," Nilekani said. "If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder." India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India. Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's "America First" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India. "This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season," he said. "It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here." Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example. The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar. As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments. "It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians," Nilekani said. "Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems." Nilekani said the country's massive youth population is increasingly choosing to stay home and pitch in.

That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions," Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement. Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being "blacklisted" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019. Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class. The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies. Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters. "I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland," Naville said. "Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit." Related: How Europe's elections could be hacked Swiss authorities say they will move quickly to create a modified tax reform proposal. Naville said he hopes new rules are devised within the next few months. "All stakeholders now have to take responsibility to develop an acceptable competitive tax system, and to regain credibility regarding the famed political stability which gave Switzerland such an advantageous position," he said in a statement. Naville hinted that potential tax reforms in the U.S. and U.K. could tempt Swiss-based companies to relocate, putting more pressure on Switzerland's tax base.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170213104024-switzerland-referendum-tax-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/stocks-all-time-highs-donald-trump-janet-yellen-fed/index.html?section=money_news_international|Stocks hit record again. But is Trump the reason?|The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday. Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive. So is this the Donald Trump rally? Or the Janet Yellen rally? Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring. Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead? You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand. The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident. But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market. RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled "Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald." Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory. You can't have it both ways. It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose. Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress. Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well. Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too. Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose. Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win. What's really going on? The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve. Yes. the markets are reacting to Washington. But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House. The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president. The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating. Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually. But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates. Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time. That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. That's still extremely low. At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds. Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip. And consumers would probably keep spending. So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president, With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160921073004-janet-yellen-donald-trump-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/technology/apple-stock-record/index.html?section=money_news_international|Apple stock nears record high|Apple has found its groove again. The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015. The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney. Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades." Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014. The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand. Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration' Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters. Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. But that losing streak just ended. Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped." The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump. Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts. Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160727103035-apple-stocks-up-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/nafta-canada-trudeau-trump-mexico/index.html?section=money_news_international|America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico|America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships. President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada," Trump said at the news conference. But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think. There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost. "Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place," says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital. Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Canada is rarely mentioned. Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico. Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat. Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive. But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way. Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau. 1. Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA. But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies. Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S. There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico. (By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.) And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints. Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm. 2. The U.S. - Canada lumber battle NAFTA isn't the only sore area. In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was "dumping" its wood on the U.S. market. Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs. "It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while," says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal. The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair. Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute. Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada. American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004. It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing. According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from. That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge. The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff. However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again. The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs. Related: 'Without NAFTA' we'd be out of business 3. Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war Things got even worse during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade. So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers. It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act. Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was. Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war. "Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff," according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of "Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression." For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all). Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase. Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada. Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin. Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war 4. Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk Fast forward to today. Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk. For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department. Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%. "They're so onerous that you can't bring it across. There's no American eggs in Quebec," says Velk. According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different. Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs. The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's. Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market. But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now. Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about 5. COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world. In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers. For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered. Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO. The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law. American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome. As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement. The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth. --Editor's note: This story was originally published on August 11, 2016.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/verizon-stock-unlimited-data-plan/index.html?section=money_news_international|Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose|Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan. That's great if you're a Verizon customer. But it is terrible news for its investors. Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday. It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017. Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). "In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning. That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down. T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners. But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon. AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service. Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings. But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years. Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter. However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it "continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon. Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX). There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR). That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days. Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible. Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends. Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt. That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher. So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year. That's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160129141906-verizon-logo-store-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/oil-prices-opec-deal/index.html?section=money_news_international|Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why|It's a good day for OPEC. Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production. The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016. The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions. Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel. Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher: OPEC deal OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices. The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%. Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply. Crucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%. UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected. The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months. Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts Investors upbeat The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC. The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases. Higher demand The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year. Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016. The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017. Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale What's next? Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher. That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago. U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report. "This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output," said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index. More supply could once again put OPEC under pressure.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161107091529-election2016-markets-oil-up-780x439.jpg

Musk said governments must pay close attention to artificial intelligence, create sustainable transport and be wary of mass unemployment. "This will be a massive social challenge.

"They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography," Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore. Jivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand "local nuances" that would help it to identify services that "users and drivers actually want." Uber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks. Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia. The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing. Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors. In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities. Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015. "What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want," said Jivrajka. Related: Uber's rivals are teaming up in Asia Uber CEO Travis Kalanick insists that his company is not prepared to leave India.

"We need more drivers because the pace at which demand is increasing is way higher than the way supply is getting aggregated," he said.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/11/media/fake-news-apple-ceo-tim-cook/index.html?section=money_news_international|Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for "massive campaign" against fake news|Apple CEO Tim Cook wants the tech industry to take action against "fake news" stories that are polluting the web. "There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic," Cook said in a rare interview. Speaking with The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Cook also said "all of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news." Other leading tech company CEOs, like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, have spoken about the problem in recent months. But Cook's comments were much more frank. According to the Telegraph, he said made-up stories and hoaxes are "killing people's minds." And he called the "fake news" plague "a big problem in a lot of the world." The term "fake news" was originally coined to describe online stories that are designed to deceive readers. Often times these stories are shared on Facebook and other social networking sites to generate profits for the creators. Other times the stories are essentially propaganda made up for political purposes. These kinds of stories received widespread attention before and after the American election. Fictional stories with titles like "Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president" won millions of clicks. It can be very difficult for web surfers to tell the difference between legitimate news sources and fakes. That's where companies like Apple come in. In the Telegraph interview -- part of a multi-day European trip -- Cook said "too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven't figured out what to do." He urged both technological and intellectual solutions. "We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will," Cook told the newspaper. What he described is music to the ears of media literacy advocates. "It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid," Cook said. There are scattered efforts in some schools to teach media literacy, with a focus on digital skills, but it is by no means universal. When asked if Apple would commit to funding a PSA campaign, an Apple spokesman said the company had no further comment on Cook's interview. The Apple CEO also suggested that tech companies can help weed out fake stories, though he added, "We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press." Apple's own Apple News app has been credited with being a relatively reliable place to find information. The company "reviews publishers who join Apple News," BuzzFeed noted last December. And the app has a "report-a-concern function where users can flag fake news or hate speech." Facebook recently started working with fact-checkers to test "warning labels" that show up when users share made-up stories. Cook, in the newspaper interview, expressed optimism that the "fake news" plague is a "short-term thing -- I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160823191106-tim-cook-thumbnail-780x439.jpg

And now, Sears and Kmart. Sears Holdings, the company that owns retail stores Sears and Kmart, reportedly said this weekend that it would remove 31 Trump-branded items from its website. The company pulled the products as part of a plan to focus on its "most profitable items," Sears spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters. Hanover told the news organization that items in the Trump Home line of furnishings were removed from the company's website, although they could still be purchased through third-party vendors online. Neither store carried the items in their physical stores, he said. Searches of the Sears and KMart websites did not turn up Trump Home products, except for those sold by third-party vendors. In a statement Monday, spokesman Chris Brathwaite distanced Sears from any political controversy and reiterated that many Trump-branded products are still available through third-party sellers. "In this case, certain products were removed from our websites that included a very small number of Trump products," he said. "The headlines do not do justice to our business or this specific brand of products that we offer through our marketplace sellers."

Earlier this month, Nordstrom (JWN) cited brand "performance," not politics, as the reason why it decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories label. President Trump knocked the department store on Twitter in retaliation. Nordstrom stock jumped 7% in the first two days following the tweet.

Neiman Marcus removed the brand landing page from its website, and declined to tell CNNMoney whether it intended to keep Ivanka Trump products in stores or resume online sales in the future. TJX Companies (TJX), the company that owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, also said that it had recently told workers not to highlight the first daughter's brand in stores. And retailer Belk said last week that it planned to pull Ivanka Trump's products from its website, but would continue to offer the line in its flagship stores. Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line has taken a hit in recent months. Online sales of her brand dipped 26% in January compared to a year earlier, according to Slice Intelligence, a retail analysis firm. Slice studied the brand's sales on five online stores: Nordstrom, Amazon, Zappos, Macy's and Bloomingdale's. Online sales of Ivanka's brand had surged in late 2015, and last month's numbers appear to be more of a "return to reality," according to Taylor Stanton, Slice's marketing and communications manager. The brand's dip in performance was abnormal in light of an uptick in 2016 online sales in the apparel and accessories category, said Jack Beckwythe, a Slice analyst.

"We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains," Young said. Retailers like Bloomingdale's, Amazon (AMZN), Lord & Taylor, Macy's (M) and Zappos all still carry Ivanka Trump products.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/news/thailand-bamboo-cassava-packaging-universal-biopack/index.html?section=money_news_international|This company makes food packaging out of bamboo to cut down on trash|To tackle Thailand's mounting trash problem, one company is turning to the country's plant life. Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers. But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country. After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies. But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year. "Waste management is a big problem everywhere," said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin. Related: The company turning 4 billion plastic bottles into clothes The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging. It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones. The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process. In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry. But finding new clients can be tricky. Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins. Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell. "The local economy still does not support [this technology]" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin. But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand. Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand. To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing. It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100. The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million. Related: A startup that makes pencils that grow into vegetables A lot of the demand comes from overseas.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/08/news/economy/greece-imf-bailout-eurozone/index.html?section=money_news_international|another Greek debt crisis|How's this for déjà vu? Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe. Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads. Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt. Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an "explosive" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue. The timing could hardly be worse. European leaders have a lot on their plate. Elections are looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Brexit negotiations will begin within weeks. Yet the threat of Greece tumbling out of the euro demands attention. Here's why the next few weeks will be key: Hammer to fall Greece is running out of cash, but it needs to make repayments to creditors including the European Central Bank. Major bills are coming due in July. If Greece cannot make the payments, it will default on its debt and spiral out of the eurozone. Meanwhile, its latest bailout -- the third since 2010 -- is effectively frozen. The negotiating positions of major players are further apart than at any point since the bailout was agreed in June, 2015. There is even disagreement over the size of the problem facing Greece. "The IMF's latest review of Greece's debt position was surprisingly pessimistic," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of top eurozone finance officials. "It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes." I want it all The IMF, Greece and creditors led by Germany all have very different priorities. Here's what each wants: The IMF has called on Greece to make more ambitious changes to its economy, including labor market reforms. The IMF didn't join the third bailout when first agreed in 2015 because it did not view Greece's debt as being sustainable. It still maintains that Greece cannot be self sustaining without major debt relief. Greece's main creditors agree that Athens should implement the reforms proposed by the IMF. However, they have categorically ruled out any debt relief, a position reiterated by eurozone finance officials on Tuesday. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, shows no sign of yielding to demands for additional reforms. He insists that debt relief is needed before any new concessions are made. It's a classic standoff and investors are watching to see which party blinks first. Put out the fire The next major milestone is a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Feb. 20 -- the last before elections start muddying Europe's political waters. Agreeing yet more financial aid for Greece will become even harder once voters start casting their ballots. After that, bills will start coming due. Greece faces a payment to the ECB of roughly €1.4 billion in late April and another €4.1 billion in July. The stake are high. The unemployment rate in Greece is expected to run above 21% in 2017. Investment is down by more than 60% and output has contracted by more than 25% since the financial crisis. The country's social fabric is fraying. If European creditors refuse further help, Greece's debt will spiral out of control no matter how quickly its economy grows, according to the IMF. That will leave only one option -- abandoning the euro. Ted Malloch, President Trump's expected choice for U.S. ambassador to the EU, told Greek television on Tuesday that the eurozone's future would be decided in the next 18 months. "Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it's very much a question that is on the agenda," he said. "I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150520121818-loosing-on-greece-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/technology/verizon-unlimited-data-plan/index.html?section=money_news_international|Verizon is bringing back unlimited data|Verizon VZ Starting Monday, Verizon customers can get unlimited data, talk and text for $80. The company says the new introductory plan also includes up to 10 GB of mobile hotspot usage, as well as calling and texting to Mexico and Canada. It will also allow customers to stream unlimited HD video, thumbing its nose at T-Mobile's controversial practice of lowering video quality for some of its unlimited data customers. Although the new Verizon plan promises "fast LTE speeds," those using a lot of data may suffer. The company said that after a customer uses 22 gb of data on a line during any billing cycle, it "may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion." That has become standard practice on all networks that offer unlimited data plans. Related: T-Mobile and Sprint offer new 'unlimited' data plans -- sort of Verizon first eliminated its version of an unlimited usage plan in 2011, following similar decisions by other major wireless carriers. But companies have been steadily reviving such plans. Verizon first overhauled its data-usage plans last summer when it introduced a new "Safety Mode" plan. That technically gave customers access to unlimited data, but they were subjected to slow-as-molasses speeds after they went over their allotted data. AT&T similarly eliminated overage fees for customers in September. Like Verizon, AT&T throttles customers speeds once they reach the data limit on their plans. The company brought back unlimited plans earlier last year, but it is only available for homes with both AT&T's wireless phone service and either DirecTV or U-Verse TV. Meanwhile, competitors T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) made their own bids to attract customers looking for "unlimited data" plans. Nearly all NYC subways get cell service Last August, Sprint began offering a plan to give customers unlimited talk, text and high-speed data for $60 for the first line, $40 for the next, and $30 for each additional up to 10. The T-Mobile plan, announced the same day as Sprint's, charged $70 a month for the first line, the second at $50 and additional lines are only $20, up to eight lines.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160602130301-best-brand-verizon-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/news/economy/visa-ban-rural-doctor-shortage/index.html?section=money_news_international|Visa crackdown puts these rural doctors at risk|At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Dr. Alaa Al Nofal sees up to 10 patients a day. He's known some of them since they were born. Others, he still treats after they've graduated from high school. "I treat these children for Type 1 diabetes, thyroid problems, thyroid cancer, puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases," he said. Al Nofal's expertise is critical. He is one of just five full-time pediatric endocrinologists in a 150,000 square-mile area that covers both South and North Dakota. Like most of rural America, it's a region plagued by a shortage of doctors. "We're very lucky to have Dr. Al Nofal here. We can't afford to lose someone with his specialization," said Cindy Morrison, chief marketing officer for Sanford Health, a non-profit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs 300 hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities. Related: Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse Yet, Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network. A Syrian citizen, Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad 30 visa waiver -- which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J-1 exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa. The Conrad 30 waiver allows him to stay in the U.S. for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage. After President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- including Syria -- from entering the U.S., Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America. "We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country, but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America," said Al Nofal. "They may no longer want to practice in the United States." The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban. Related: Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities. Sanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order. "If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families," said Sanford Health's Morrison. And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too. The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S. More than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas. About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place. The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of "national interest," but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration. "The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas," said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia. Related: Obamacare's impact on this Alaska town with only one doctor's office Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa. He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls. Nineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average. He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment. Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away. "It's not easy being a doctor in this setting," said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters. "But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it." It's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban. "I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now. My family in Syria can't come here," he said. "Now my family can't meet their first grandson." "I know if we leave I probably can never come back," he said. Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now. "I'm afraid of how I will be treated," he said. He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state. Related: Trump travel ban and what you need to know Almatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July. Everything was going smoothly. Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted. He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer. But there was one last step. For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. "The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department," he said. Because he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome. "The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors. Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me," he said. "No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy," he said. "Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170210105854-dr-nofal-patient-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/investing/stocks-united-states-trump-europe-china-japan/index.html?section=money_news_international|Trump isn't killing the bull market. Here's why|More and more business leaders and Wall Street strategists are expressing their worries about what President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and unpredictable nature might do to the markets and economy. But we all know that action speaks louder than words. What investors are actually doing is in stark contrast to what people are saying. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs again on Friday. And the Russell 2000, an index of small company stocks that tend to do most of their business in the U.S., is now just a few points away from the all-time high it hit last December in the wake of Trump market euphoria. What's more, the VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is down nearly 25% this year as well. If investors were really scared of Trump, the VIX should be much higher. And CNNMoney's own Fear & Greed Index, which looks at the VIX and six other measures of investor sentiment, is showing signs of Greed and is not far from Extreme Greed levels. Of course, Trump still can't seem to help himself from tweeting about things that, let's be honest, won't do anything to help the economy -- although Nordstrom investors are richer despite Trump attacking them for dumping his daughter Ivanka's brand. But to give credit where it's due, it looks like the main reason that stocks have taken off again lately is because Trump has promised to unveil a "phenomenal" tax plan soon. Related: Rare streak for U.S. stocks: Long stretch without a 1% dive Trump also pledged again to invest more on infrastructure when he met with airline CEOs on Thursday. That's what the market wants to hear. "We still expect fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and less regulation," said Matt Lockridge, manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value Fund. "The timing is the big question, but it's coming." Lockridge thinks that many companies that generate a majority of their revenues from America should benefit if Trump stimulus winds up kicking the economy into a higher gear. He likes stocks in a variety of industries, such as movie theater owner Masco (MAS), snack food firm J & J (JJSF) and aerospace equipment company Kaman (KAMN). Another money manager said he's also still bullish on small U.S. stocks that could get a lift from Trump policies. Related: Wall Street has powerful seat at Trump's table Barry James, president and CEO of James Investment Research, said he bought the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) the day after the election because he's confident Trump's stimulus plan will boost growth for U.S small businesses. "When Trump said America first, I really think that's what he means," James said, adding that he thinks Internet phone service Vonage (VG), rent-to-own retailer Aaron's (AAN) and discount chain Big Lots (BIG) could all thrive if Trump's proposals go through. But there's another reason why the U.S. markets are near all-time highs. Despite all of the uncertainty in Washington, the U.S. is still viewed as a paragon of relative stability compared to other parts of the world. Europe's economy is still a big wild card thanks to Brexit, the rise of populism in France leading to worries about a so-called Frexit and more worries about the problem that never seems to go away -- Greece's debt woes. Japan's economy remains stagnant as well. We're talking about more than just a lost decade now. It's plural. And China's economy is slowing down too. Bond fund manager Bill Gross has often joked that America is like what Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson sang about in "Sunday Morning Coming Down" -- the "cleanest dirty shirt." To that end, analysts at bond rating firm Fitch wrote in a report Friday that "elements of President Trump's economic agenda would be positive for growth," but added that "the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome." Of course, there are two sides to that coin. Trump's bombast could come back to haunt him. Related: Oreo make is worried about rise of populism His continued penchant for reprimanding companies that he disagrees with on Twitter could dent investor confidence. And while his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries has been overturned by the U.S. court system for now, the president has vowed to fight for its reinstatement. Even if he loses that battle, it's still clear that Trump is serious on turning more inward, with plans for tariffs and border-adjusted taxes that could ignite trade wars with Mexico, China and Japan. That could hurt big U.S. multinational firms and lead to job cuts. But investors still seem to believe/hope that the merits of Trump's pro-growth stimulus plans and tax cuts will outweigh the impact of isolationism. Let's hope they're right. Investors may be holding their noses, closing their eyes and stuffing cotton in their ears to drown out the president. But they are still buying stocks.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170208121205-trump-bull-780x439.jpg

Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job. “Back then, two dollars an hour, that was real money,” Ford tells CNN’s Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files. Now, as the first female CEO of Land O’Lakes — and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies — Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that “while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.” “She said, ‘Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don’t disappoint,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve gotta work hard to not disappoint,’” Ford says. Ford has a vision for Land O’Lakes. She wants to transform people’s perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it’s making in the ag-tech space. “My vision is to continue to invest in technology,” she says. “You have to have agility. E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there’s an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O’ Lakes is.” The future of Land O’Lakes In July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move China called the beginning of “the biggest trade war in economic history.” In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans. “Grain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs,” Ford says. “Export market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we’re seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment.” Ford says she’s spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics. “What I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft,” she says. “They want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they’re supportive.” More than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity — quickly. “Time is critical,” she says. “So then what’s the most important thing the administration can do? They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues.” Being a first When the announcement about Ford’s promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important “first” in Fortune 500 history. With Ford’s promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company. In the months since, she’s heard from people about how much that “first” has meant to them. “People have come up to me and said, ‘Thank you,’” she says. “And it’s not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, ‘Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.’” Ford says she’s never faced discrimination in her career, but she’s definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family. “I had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly,” she says. “I said, ‘The job looks great. You’re a wonderful leader. I can’t be here because I don’t think this will be great. My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter.” Thinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500, she says progress can’t be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases — something that she sees as “a shared responsibility” for management teams and their talent development programs. On that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: “Beth, if you want something, ask for it.” “You expect you’re going to be recognized because you’ve done the hard work, and that isn’t actually how it always happens,” Ford says.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001100059-beth-ford-land-olakes-ceo.jpg?q=x_208,y_75,h_867,w_1541,c_crop/w_800

The Goldman Sachs economics team “almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition,” Hassett told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Tuesday. The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019. Hassett said he hadn’t read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman’s track record. Hassett claimed its analysis of last year’s tax cuts was “really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way.” He said Goldman’s analysis predicted the tax cuts would be “really harmful” to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed. “So maybe they’re just trying to make a partisan point before the elections,” said Hassett, chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Keep in mind that Goldman Sachs (GS), like other investment banks, charges clients to access their economic and market insights. Investors rely on that research to be nonpartisan. Goldman Sachs declined to comment about the criticism. It marks another chapter in Team Trump’s love-hate relationship with Goldman Sachs, the most powerful firm on Wall Street. Trump blasted Goldman Sachs during the 2016 presidential campaign. He claimed Goldman Sachs had “total, total control” over his rivals Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. Trump’s closing campaign ad flashed an image of Lloyd Blankfein, then the CEO of Goldman Sachs, as the candidate’s narration condemned the “global power structure” for robbing America’s working class. After the election, Trump reversed course. He named former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin to the powerful role of Treasury secretary. Trump hired Gary Cohn, a registered Democrat who was then president of Goldman Sachs, to be the face of his economic team. (Cohn left earlier this year because of a disagreement over trade.) In the 2016 race, Clinton received $388,426 from individuals at Goldman Sachs, more than any other candidate, according to OpenSecrets. Trump received $5,607, according to OpenSecrets. Then again, Goldman Sachs employees contributed more to Republicans than Democrats overall in 2016 federal races. Blankfein backed Clinton in the election. However, after the election, Blankfein gave Trump credit for the soaring American economy. “If the president didn’t win, and Hillary Clinton won … I bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be,” Blankfein told CNN in February. Veterans of Goldman Sachs have gone on to work in Republican and Democratic administrations. Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, served as Treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton. Hank Paulson had been the chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs before leading the Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush during the 2008 financial crisis.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002105430-100218-kevin-hassett.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/19/investing/china-trade-war-yuan-currency/index.html?section=money_news_economy|China says it will never use its currency as a weapon in the trade war|The trade war between China and the United States is intensifying, but Beijing has just taken one potential weapon off the table. Premier Li Keqiang told an audience of global executives and policymakers that China would not weaken the yuan to boost trade with the rest of the world. "China will never go down the path of stimulating exports by devaluing its currency," Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday. His comments came a day after the United States and China announced that they would impose their biggest rounds of tariffs yet on each other's exports, starting next week. That brings the value of goods hit by tariffs in the escalating conflict to more than $360 billion. President Donald Trump has threatened to hit another $267 billion of Chinese goods with tariffs. China, which buys far less from the United States than the other way round, is starting to run low on American products to target, raising speculation about what other measures it could take to hit back. Driving down the currency, which is also known as the renminbi, isn't one of them, according to Li. "Persistent depreciation of the renminbi will only do more harm than good to our country," he said during a speech at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. The yuan has dropped sharply against the dollar as the trade fight has ramped up, losing about 9% of its value since April. Accused of manipulation The decline has drawn the attention of President Trump, who has often accused China of devaluing the yuan to boost its huge export industry. Trump claimed in July that China was "manipulating" its currency lower. Li dismissed that idea on Wednesday. "The recent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen by some as an intentional measure on the part of China," he said. "This is simply not true." The Chinese government plays a significant role in setting the value of the yuan and how it trades. Economists generally agree Beijing kept the currency artificially low in the past, but they are skeptical that government intervention has driven it down against the dollar and other major currencies this year. They say the escalating trade war with the United States and concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have helped push the yuan lower at a time when the US Federal Reserve is steadily raising interest rates. That policy makes it more attractive for investors to hold assets in US dollars, prompting them to sell other currencies. Sudden drops in the yuan in 2015 and early 2016 set off turmoil in global markets as money poured out of China's economy. Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping it up. China will "work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable," Li said Wednesday. His words weren't enough to convince everyone, though. "Manipulation has occurred and is occurring, and I hope that action is taken," Todd Rokita, a Trump-supporting congressman from Indiana, told CNN at the Tianjin conference just minutes after Li's speech.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170406134445-yuan-china-flat-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/investing/stocks-week-ahead-tesla-elon-musk/index.html?section=money_news_economy|The next big test for Elon Musk arrives this week|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on September 30, 2018. New York CNN Business — 1. Back to business: The SEC is off Elon Musk’s back. Now he and Tesla can return to that other pesky problem — making and selling cars. Tesla will turn in a critical production report on Tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week. That report will go a long way toward determining whether Tesla (TSLA) can fulfill Musk’s pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters. Since it went public, Tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black. It posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of June. That seems like a long time ago. In early August, Musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators — a cryptic announcement that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC said he had no such thing, and sued Musk last week for misleading investors. Under a settlement announced Saturday, Musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines. Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement. The SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up. A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs. That’s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt. The markets have reflected investors’ worry. Tesla bonds maturing in August 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, close to a record low. And Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet. The stock may bounce back Monday, now that the uncertainty over Musk’s future is removed. But Wall Street still wants something else — results. 2. Jobs, jobs, jobs: Analysts expect another month of solid growth when the US Labor Department issues its September jobs report on Friday. More important may be the wage growth figure: Will it hit 3% for the first time since April 2009? If so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive Federal Reserve? 3. Changing of the guard at Goldman: Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday. He will be replaced by Goldman president — and part-time DJ — David Solomon. The investment firm’s stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year. Solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from Goldman’s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies. 4. Earnings watch: It’s a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi (PEP), Stitch Fix, Bon-Ton and Costco. For Pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under CEO Indra Nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company’s global operations chief, Ramon Laguarta. The stock could use a caffeine boost: It’s down 7% this year. 5. Rebooting business news: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward. This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind. 6.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/investing/insider-selling-stocks-buybacks/index.html?section=money_news_economy|CEOs are cashing in on the market boom|CEOs are using the market boom to quietly cash in their own chips. Insiders at US companies have dumped $5.7 billion of stock this month, the highest in any September over the past decade, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by TrimTabs Investment Research. It's not a new trend. Insiders, which include corporate officers and directors, sold shares in August at the fastest pace in 10 years as well, TrimTabs said. The selling is noteworthy because it occurred as the market rebounded sharply from an early 2018 tumble. Fueled by tax cuts and a strong economy, the Dow recently notched its first record high since January. Some corporate insiders have much of their net worth tied up in stock, so it could be that they are simply exercising caution. The bull market, already the longest history, can't last forever. "It's a very prudent thing for them to unload some shares -- no matter how much they like the stock," said Joe Saluzzi, co-partner at brokerage firm Themis Trading. "It doesn't necessarily mean they see something wrong." TrimTabs does not break down how many of the insider sales were pre-planned. The SEC allows executives to schedule stock sales ahead of time to avoid the appearance of insider trading. While the captains of Corporate America are cashing out, they are doing the exact opposite with shareholder money. US public companies have authorized a stunning $827.4 billion of stock buybacks in 2018 -- already a record for any year, according to TrimTabs. Apple (AAPL) alone announced plans last quarter for $100 billion of buybacks. The flurry of buybacks has been viewed by investors as a sign of confidence among CEOs. "Insiders aren't announcing buybacks because they think stocks are cheap," said David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs. "What they're doing with shareholders' money and their own is quite different." Companies use buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders. Share repurchases benefit investors -- and executives that are paid mostly in stock -- by providing persistent demand that tends to boost prices. Buybacks also artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding. Corporate America is enjoying record profitability thanks to the strong economy and a big reduction in what they owe Uncle Sam. The Republican tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and also gave companies a break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States. The tax windfall has also enabled companies to spend more on job-creating investments like new equipment and research projects. But buybacks are growing even faster. In fact, Goldman Sachs found that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 companies for the first time in a decade. Given the spike in buybacks, Saluzzi said it would be odd if insiders are rapidly dumping shares outside of preplanned transactions. "You've got to raise your eyebrows and look at what's going on here," Saluzzi said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926121811-ceos-stock-insider-selling-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/news/companies/ge-stock-market-value/index.html?section=money_news_economy|GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession|General Electric, once America's most valuable company, is now in sharp decline. In a year full of dubious landmarks, GE has encountered another: The storied conglomerate is now worth less than $100 billion. That hasn't happened since March 2009 -- during the Great Recession. GE's (GE) stock crash -- down by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016 -- has knocked the company down to the 59th most valuable in the S&P 500. It's a stunning reversal. GE was No. 1 in the S&P 500 as recently as 2004, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. At the time, it was worth nearly $400 billion. Now GE is worth just a tenth of Apple (AAPL), the $1 trillion top dog of the market, and it's fallen behind Salesforce (CRM), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA). GE's struggles got it kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this summer. GE was an original member of the exclusive index in 1896 and had been in it continuously for 110 years. Plunging profits and mounting debt have driven GE's shares down by 35% this year. Only four S&P 500 companies have had a worse 2018. The most remarkable part about GE's decline is it comes at a time when the American economy and stock market are soaring. Rival industrial companies including Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming. But GE has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that have finally come home to roost. To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, GE is selling off countless businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison's light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines. Selling in GE's stock has accelerated in recent days because of worries about GE Power, the most troubled part of the slumping conglomerate. GE confirmed last week that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants. The turbine trouble could hurt the company's reputation and sales at a time when it's already strapped for cash. In a statement, GE said that it has "identified a fix" and has been working with customers to "quickly return units to service." JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr, Wall Street's biggest GE bear, told clients the turbine failure "raises red flags" about GE Power. Others think that shareholders are overreacting. Most likely, GE's "fundamental technology is sound" and repair costs will be "manageable," Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin wrote to clients.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926101913-02-general-electric-power-plant-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/25/news/economy/bonds-rising-rates-federal-reserve-economy/index.html?section=money_news_economy|Why investors aren't freaking out about inflation|Bond yields in the United States have been rising. But investors aren't freaking out. The Dow and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs last week -- and the Nasdaq is not far from a record, either. The 10-Year Treasury yield is still relatively low, but it has topped the psychologically important 3% threshold and is currently hovering around 3.1%. The concern is that this may be just the beginning. Longer-term rates could keep climbing given that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term rates Wednesday. At some point, investors may start to grow wary of what rising rates will mean for consumer spending and businesses looking to borrow more money. Higher rates, in theory, should lead to slower growth for both the economy and corporate earnings. The question is: how many more rate hikes are coming? Fed chair Jerome Powell may provide some clues at a press conference after the Fed decision is announced. Craig Birk, chief investment officer of Personal Capital, said that the market should be able to handle a few more quarter-point rate increases. But many investors may have gotten spoiled since rates were unusually low for so long. The federal funds rate is now in a range of 1.75% to 2% and there are expectations it could climb above 3% over the next year. Birk said many investors are hoping the Fed will end its rate hiking campaign in 2019 though. "We finally have a real interest rate, not one that's just zero," Birk said. "The Fed is still saying that they will likely raise rates slowly and steadily but the market seems to be betting they will stop sooner." Birk added the Fed had been run by so-called doves, people like former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen who preferred to keep rates low, for years. Investors are trying to adjust to the new mindset at the Fed. "The market is still getting used to the idea that the Fed will be more balanced and more hawkish," Birk said. In other words, investors may be underestimating the willingness of the Fed to keep raising rates -- despite criticism from President Donald Trump about rate hikes and even if the data doesn't conclusively show inflation picking up in a meaningful way. Still, some experts think the Fed is likely to stick to its path of gradual rate increases. Powell, like his predecessors, is probably not interested in rattling the bond and stock markets with surprise moves. "We do not see rising interest rates as a reason to sell stocks, particularly in the absence of runaway inflation," wrote John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, in a report Tuesday. Inflation is still under control for now Wage growth is picking up, but that hasn't led to a big spike in consumer prices. So the Fed may still have some wiggle room to keep raising rates since the economy appears to be on solid footing. "The market is interpreting higher rates as a response to better growth, not as a reason to fear a policy mistake, which we find encouraging," Lynch added. Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, isn't overly worried about inflation getting out of control either. "It's premature to say the Fed is behind the curve," said Keon. "The question is what happens next year and 2020. There are some reasons to believe price pressures may continue to build. I don't think rates will get too high." Keon thinks the 10-Year Treasury yield could climb to a range of about 3.25% to 3.5%. That's still low enough to keep the economy humming along at a relatively solid clip, even if growth slows a bit. So the biggest change that might come from the Fed's rate hikes is a shift in the types of stocks that investors favor most. Tech stocks, retailers and other consumer companies, big winners of the past year, may start to lose some ground to financials. Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist with INTL FCStone, is bullish on regional bank stocks (KRE) and Bank of America (BAC), which has a big mortgage business. They should benefit from higher rates since it will make their lending operations more profitable.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180731103144-markets-volatile-federal-reserve-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/media/reliable-sources-10-02-18/index.html?section=money_media|Reliable Sources: How the NYT uncovered new info about Trump’s wealth|New York CNN Business — A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You can sign up for free right here. Trump’s $$$$ Susanne Craig says this investigation was, without a doubt, the hardest story she’s ever done. “Imagine,” she says, “someone tossing a million white puzzle pieces into Times Square and being asked to put it back together.” Those puzzle pieces were about the Trump family business. Craig, David Barstow and Russ Buettner pieced it all together for an extraordinary story, published by the NYT on Tuesday afternoon. It will fill eight special pages of the print edition on Wednesday. Here’s the front page: If you haven’t read it yet, click here. The Times also (helpfully!) published a list of 11 takeaways from the investigation. And here’s CNN’s story about it. Now for the story behind the story… NYT assistant managing editor Sam Dolnick called this “investigative reporter serendipity:” Exactly two years ago, on October 1, 2016, “the same NYT crew published a Trump taxes story after an anonymous source sent Susanne Craig 1995 tax records,” he tweeted. Trump, of course, was elected without ever disclosing his taxes. Flash forward five months. In March 2017, David Cay Johnston obtained a copy of Trump’s 2005 returns. (Remember when he broke the story on Rachel Maddow’s show?) “That triggered our journey,” Craig told me. So it’s fair to say this was an 18-month investigation… The sourcing The trio obtained confidential tax returns. Financial records. Depositions. And so on. How? I’ll leave that up to you to speculate. “We had thousands of documents. Hundreds of tax returns,” Craig told me. “Piecing all that together, understanding what they did, was beyond hard. We triangulated documents. Compared tax returns to financial statements and bank statements. And then talked to sources on it. Today we put it into one story, all explained. But it started with piles” of information sitting in the corner of the room. A room with a locked door Buettner, Barstow and Craig worked in a small room on the fourth floor of NYT HQ. One of the only treats: a bottle of Jameson on the shelf. Most NYT reporters work from open cubicles. But the trio needed privacy. So the room was kept locked, and they were the only ones with keys… A multimedia rollout I mentioned the “takeaways” list earlier. The NYT also had a video ready to go on Tuesday. And the same documentary crew that made “The Fourth Estate” for Showtime also tagged along on this investigation. Showtime will air the resulting “documentary short,” titled “The Family Business: Trump and Taxes,” this Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET. It’s directed by Jenny Carchman, produced by Liz Garbus and Justin Wilkes… And it’s still in the works… It’ll run approximately 30 minutes on Sunday… Trumpworld’s threat: Harder calls the story “highly defamatory” When the story dropped on Tuesday, many journalists commented – in awe and envy – on the super-confident tone of the story. The NYT reached what NPR’s David Folkenflik likes to call “earned conclusions.” These are not opinions – these are conclusions that come from months and months of obsessive hard work. For example, the lead of the story: Trump “participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s” that included “instances of outright fraud.” That is quite a conclusion. One of Trump’s pitbull lawyers, Charles Harder, sent a statement to the NYT on Monday after the paper sent him a “detailed description of its findings.” Harder said “The New York Times’s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory. There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.” A statement from Sanders… or from Trump? Harder’s statement was followed by a release from Sarah Sanders. W.H. reporters pointed out that it sounded like it came straight from Trump’s mouth. “But the statement doesn’t dispute any facts in the story,” the NYT’s Peter Baker tweeted. “Instead it attacks the newspaper and repeats the lie that the NYT apologized for 2016 coverage, which it did not.” Fox’s spin Here’s the thing about an 18-month investigation like this: There’s no real way for other news outlets to “match” the story for days… or more realistically for weeks or months. So other outlets have to report it with attribution to the NYT. I found it funny when Fox’s Kevin Corke told viewers, during the 4 p.m. hour, “we’ll keep digging.” How? Well, he said he had reached out to W.H. officials. I can’t think of a worse possible way to report on Trump’s taxes. Anchor Neil Cavuto, meanwhile, downplayed the story by saying “I don’t know if there’s a there there.” This is one of those times when Fox’s coverage actually does a disservice to its viewers… There’s still so much we don’t know This story is about the Trump family, with documents dating back decades. But what about Trump’s more recent tax returns? His more recent accounting practices? “The records reviewed by the Times did not include Trump’s personal tax returns or his recent business dealings,” CNN’s story notes. Craig tweeted, “It really underscores the need for presidents – Donald Trump in particular – to release their tax returns.” Baker tweeted a similar point: “Trump could help clarify anything he thinks is misleading by releasing his tax returns, as every other president has done for decades.” – MORE TO COME? Craig told me, “We have a lot more we want to dig into…” – TUNE IN: Craig is booked on “GMA” and Barstow is booked on “New Day” Wednesday morning… The day’s other Times-related news… Oliver Darcy emails: Earlier on Tuesday, before the Trump wealth story came out, the NYT tried to put out a fire about its Monday night story involving Brett Kavanaugh and a 1985 bar fight. The Times said it made a mistake by allowing an NYT Mag staff writer who had tweeted negatively about Kavanaugh, Emily Bazelon, to co-byline the story. Read more of Tuesday’s Reliable Sources newsletter… And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox… A spokesperson defended the story – it was “straightforward, fact-based and we fully stand behind it” – but said “editors should have used a newsroom reporter” to get ahold of the documents in New Haven, CT.

Emily Bazelon, who is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and a fellow at Yale Law School, co-authored a story published on Monday about a bar fight in 1985 during which Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice at another customer. The Times’ story was based on a police report about the incident. But Bazelon had posted a tweet in July in which she called Kavanaugh a “5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society.” That tweet drew the attention of a number of critics who contended Bazelon’s opposition to Kavanaugh presented a conflict of interest for The Times. “What motivated New York Times reporter to write this ridiculous story?” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, asked on Twitter. “Throwing ice 33 years ago, or her opinion of Judge Kavanaugh in July?” Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted, “As someone who has worked with press my entire career, and respects the vast majority, this kind of thing destroys my ability to tell conservatives they’re not out to get you. This is outrageous.” A spokesperson for The Times said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that the story Bazelon contributed to was “straightforward, fact-based and we fully stand behind it.” The spokesperson, however, said the reporting should have been assigned to another person. “Emily Bazelon is a writer for The New York Times Magazine who occasionally writes op-eds for the opinion section. She is not a newsroom reporter,” the spokesperson for The Times said. “Her role in this story was to help colleagues in the newsroom gather public documents in New Haven, where Emily is based. In retrospect, editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment.” This is the second instance in recent weeks in which The Times has been widely criticized for alleged bias against conservatives. In mid-September, the newspaper amended a report that improperly blamed pricey curtains on Nikki Haley, the United Nations ambassador, after a storm of outrage.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002120316-new-york-times-brett-kavanaugh.jpg?q=w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/media/white-house-press-briefing-september/index.html?section=money_media|There was only one White House press briefing in the entire month of September|CNN — President Trump is talking with the press corps all the time. But his accessibility is increasing at the same time the White House press briefings are decreasing. For the entire month of September, a period jam-packed with presidential news, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders only held one on-camera briefing, according to CNN’s count. This is a new low for briefings, which were an almost-daily occurrence in past administrations. Sanders has been cutting back on briefings for several months. The reductions coincide with the arrival of former Fox News co-President Bill Shine as Trump’s deputy chief of staff for communications. Sanders held five briefings in June, three in July, and five in August. So the previously “daily” briefing has become a “special occasion” event. The sole briefing in September was on the 10th. It lasted 44 minutes, but Council of Economic Advisers chief Kevin Hassett spoke during most of the first half of the briefing about policies that have boosted the US economy. The White House’s strategy, as of late, is to put Trump front and center, at the expense of on-camera briefings from spokespeople. While reporters are always hungry for opportunities to pose questions to the president, briefings have historically served a different and complementary purpose. On Sunday’s “Fox News Sunday,” moderator Chris Wallace asked Sanders, “Are you thinking of ending the formal briefings?” No, Sanders said, “certainly we’re going to continue” to hold briefings. But she downplayed the value of the briefing by saying “we talk to the press in a number of different ways.” And she said Q&A’s with the president are “infinitely better than talking to me.” “We try to do that a lot, and you’ve seen us do that a lot over the last three weeks, and that’s going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the President of the United States,” she said. So in other words, she’ll fill in sometimes when Trump does not take questions from the press corps. This is a markedly different approach to the briefing than past administrations adopted. During the Bush and Obama years, there were briefings on most days when the president was not traveling. It’s also a change from the early days of the Trump administration, when Sean Spicer held regular briefings. Trump reportedly scrutinized Spicer’s performance. And he sometimes publicly undermined statements Spicer made from the podium. That problem has also cropped up in the 14 months that Sanders has been press secretary. Reporters tend to bemoan the White House press shop’s stonewalling and misleading statements. But the disappearance of the briefing is a significant change nonetheless. While leaving more of the talking to Trump may be politically expedient, it is disadvantageous to the press, because the briefing format allows for different types of questions and a fuller range of questioners. Olivier Knox, the president of the White House Correspondents Association, said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” last month that the briefing “has both a symbolic and a substantive importance… It is not the end-all and be-all of our work, but it symbolically shows that the most powerful political institution in American life is not above being questioned.” Knox said the cutbacks to the briefings are a particular concern to reporters from smaller news outlets, like “the folks who have a harder time getting their e-mails returned by White House staff, the folks who don’t have senior officials on speed dial.” He said those reporters “used to find the briefing to be a good space in which they could ask questions that might not be on the number one or two topic of the day” but are important nevertheless. Those topics are unlikely to come up when reporters holler questions at the president at an informal Q&A session. On Monday, for example, Trump took questions during an event that was meant to tout his new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, but he bristled when reporters tried to ask about non-trade topics. Eventually, though, he answered several questions about Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. At a press briefing, reporters would be able to ask about a myriad of other topics. Even if they don’t get satisfying answers, they can show that the question was asked. Knox said he has lobbied Sanders about the reduction in briefings, and “she’s heard us out.” CNN’s Betsy Klein and Kevin Liptak contributed reporting.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180910163821-sarah-sanders-new-york-times-oped-response-sot-nr-vpx-00002029.jpg?q=x_161,y_31,h_903,w_1604,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/media/jemele-hill-the-atlantic/index.html?section=money_media|Jemele Hill is joining The Atlantic|New York CNN Business — Jemele Hill is heading to The Atlantic. The former ESPN host is joining the magazine as a staff writer covering the intersection of sports, race and politics. She will also have a podcast. “Jemele is a wonderfully talented journalist who is famous for her acute commentary, fearless writing and encyclopedic knowledge of sports,” said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, in a statement. “But what drew us to Jemele in particular is her deep commitment to reporting.” Hill said in a statement that joining The Atlantic “made perfect sense” because sports is a “great entry point for exploring what’s happening in the wider society.” She added: “You can’t talk about sports without talking about race, class, gender and politics. I want to explore the complications and discomforts with a publication that has a long history of supporting this kind of work.” In September, Hill announced she was leaving ESPN after 12 year at the network. ESPN expert and author James Andrew Miller revealed in the Hollywood Reporter that Hill had more than two years left on her contract but the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement on what her role would be. “It just kind of became obvious to me that the relationship—as good and as fruitful and as beneficial as it was—had really run its course,” Hill told Miller in THR. She had a tumultuous past few years and was criticized by the White House for calling President Trump a “white supremacist” on her personal Twitter account. Hill eventually apologized for her comments. Hill was at the center of another controversy in October 2017 for comments she made on Twitter about Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and the NFL. ESPN suspended her for two weeks for violating the network’s social media guidelines. Her role as co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter, dubbed SC6, only lasted a year. The show, with co-anchor Michael Smith, shifted from news to opinion, but it wasn’t well-received by viewers. Miller described it as “one of the most misguided and mismanaged misadventures” in recent ESPN history. “So much has happened in the last year that I felt like this is as an appropriate time as ever to spread my wings in different ways that I hadn’t really thought of before, or that I knew were possible,” Hill told THR.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001104458-jemele-hill.jpg?q=x_2,y_495,h_1156,w_2054,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/media/washington-times-aaron-rich/index.html?section=money_media|The Washington Times settles lawsuit with Seth Rich’s brother, issues retraction and apology for its coverage|New York CNN Business — The Washington Times on Monday issued a lengthy retraction and apology for an editorial it published in March about Aaron Rich, the brother of the slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich whose unsolved murder became the basis for conspiracy theories on the far-right. “The Column included statements about Aaron Rich, the brother of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, that we now believe to be false,” read part of the retraction. The retraction added, “The Washington Times apologizes to Mr. Rich and his family. All online copies of the Column have been deleted and all online content referencing the Column has been deleted to the extent within The Washington Times’ control.” The retraction came as part of a settlement Aaron Rich reached with The Washington Times after he filed a lawsuit against the conservative newspaper – and others – in March, his attorney Michael Gottlieb told CNN. Gottlieb declined to discuss other terms of the settlement, but said that the “apology and retraction are robust” and that he saw it as “a significant step forward in clearing Aaron’s name.” In a statement, Aaron Rich said he accepted the newspaper’s apology. “The last two years have brought unimaginable pain and grief to my family and me,” Aaron Rich said. “I lost my only brother to a murder that to this date has not been solved, only to then have politically-motivated conspiracy theorists falsely accuse me of grotesque criminal acts. I accept the Washington Times’ retraction and apology, and I am grateful that the Washington Times has acknowledged the indisputable truth that these allegations are, and always have been, false. As to the remaining defendants, I look forward to my day in court.” The Washington Times’ initial article, which the lawsuit said was published both online and in print, stated that it was “well known in intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information.” The article cited no evidence to support the assertion. “The Washington Times now does not have any basis to believe any part of that statement to be true, and The Washington Times retracts it in its entirety,” the newspaper’s Monday retraction said. Seth Rich was fatally shot in Washington, DC, in July 2016. Police have said evidence indicates he was the victim of a botched robbery, but in the wake of his death, far-right activists and media organizations suggested something far more sinister. Without real evidence, they peddled a conspiracy theory that said Seth Rich leaked a trove of DNC emails to Wikileaks and was killed in retribution for the supposed leak. The theory was convenient for some on the right as they disputed allegations Russia hacked the DNC, something President Donald Trump had raised doubts about. While Aaron Rich reached a settlement with The Washington Times and will be dropping the newspaper from his lawsuit, he will continue to pursue legal action against the other parties he alleges defamed him, Gottlieb said. Those parties include Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, fringe Internet activist Matt Couch, and Couch’s media company America First Media. When previously asked about the lawsuit, Butowsky told CNN he had no idea what Aaron Rich was “talking about” and asked, “I have nothing else to say, other than how many more family members do the Riches have that want to sue me?” Couch said in a Persicope video at the time that he was “being sued for investigating the truth” and signaled to his audience that he would not back down.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180522112541-seth-rich-lawsuit.jpg?q=x_814,y_424,h_850,w_1511,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/media/katie-couric-reliable-sources/index.html?section=money_media|Katie Couric: News need more diversity at the top|New York CNN Business — In her most pointed comments to date about allegations of harassment at CBS, Katie Couric said the reports about the network’s toxic, male-centric culture ring true. CEO Leslie Moonves and “60 Minutes” executive producer Jeff Fager left the company this month after an investigation into claims of misconduct turned up numerous examples. Both men have denied allegations against them. “The culture I found at ’60 Minutes’ personally was very challenging and at times quite offensive,” she told CNN’s Brian Stelter on “Reliable Sources” Sunday. “I think obsequious and subservience was a job requirement in order to thrive there for many women in particular.” “Sucking up to the boss?” Stelter asked. “Pretty much, yeah,” said Couric, who worked at CBS between 2006 to 2011 as a news anchor and a contributor to “60 minutes”. Couric also worked with Matt Lauer for years as a co-host on NBC’s “Today.” Lauer was fired by NBC last year over alleged sexual harassment. Lauer denied engaging in “coercive, aggressive or abusive actions,” though he said he “fully acknowledged” he at times “acted inappropriately.” Couric said Sunday that Lauer was a “terrific professional partner with me for many years” and she was “unaware of any kind of this behavior, predatory behavior.” “It was obviously very shocking and disturbing to me and a lot of his colleagues,” Couric said. She said these highly publicized examples point to a larger problem in newsrooms, most of which are run by men. “I think that obviously the male hierarchy has been in place [at CBS] for years, and it’s time for that to end. But they’re not the only network that has a male hierarchy,” she said. “If you look at the news presidents at every major broadcast and cable network, they’re all male.” Shortly after the interview, Couric noted to Stelter that Fox News does have a female boss, Suzanne Scott, who became CEO earlier this year. Jay Wallace is the president of Fox News. On air, Couric continued: “All three evening news anchors are male. The vast majority of executive producers at every network are male. And this really has to end.” Couric added that “implicit bias” needs to be “understood better in media circles.” She described the term as “cultural conditioning that causes us to look at people a certain way.” Couric said she has been guilty of it herself. During the presidential election 10 years ago, she said she questioned aloud whether Sarah Palin, then-Governor of Alaska and John McCain’s running mate, could handle being vice president with five children. “I would never ask that question about a male candidate,” she said. “I think we have so much work to do.” Couric said movements like #MeToo should help guide newsrooms toward better parity. “If we really believe that the tone at the top is paramount, then you have to have more diverse voices at the top because they have such an impact on the editorial choices that are made, who covers stories and how they’re covered,” Couric said.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180930154704-katie-couric-metoo.jpg?q=x_174,y_346,h_1436,w_2551,c_crop/w_800

New York CNN Business — The allegations of sexual misconduct at CBS have drawn the attention of the Manhattan district attorney’s office. The network which forced out Chairman and CEO Les Moonves three weeks ago has received subpoenas about those allegations from both the district attorney and the New York City Human Rights Commission, the company disclosed in a filing late Friday. The company said it is cooperating with the subpoenas. A spokesperson for CBS declined to comment about the filing. The filing does not say exactly who is being investigated, the company or individuals. The district attorney has the power to bring criminal charges against individuals. A spokesperson for the office declined to say whether Moonves or any other individual is a subject of investigation. A spokesperson for Moonves could not be reached Friday evening. The company had disclosed on August 1 that it had hired two outside law firms to conduct an investigation into allegations against Moonves, executives at CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of CBS. Its filing Friday said that probe is ongoing. Despite the earlier allegations and the probe, Moonves remained atop the media company until September 9, when The New Yorker published a follow-up story in which additional women made allegations of either physically forced or coerced oral sex. Moonves admitted to consensual relations with three of the women named in the article but denied what he called the “appalling accusations” in the report. In May, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office charged movie producer Harvey Weinstein with rape in the first and third degrees and committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree. The New Yorker was one of the publications that broke the story of allegations against Weinstein. Weinstein, who has maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone, pleaded not guilty in the case.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180731000131-cnnmoney-les-moonves.jpg?q=x_4,y_199,h_2156,w_3831,c_crop/w_800

New York CNN Business — The Murdoch family won big for steering the sale of most of 21st Century Fox to Disney. A new government filing reveals just how big of a win they achieved. Rupert Murdoch, the family patriarch and executive chairman of Fox (FOX), made $49.2 million during the latest fiscal year, a big chunk of which was in stock awards. That’s about $20 million more than he made last year. Murdoch’s sons, executive chairman Lachlan and CEO James, made about $50 million each -— about $30 million more than what they each made last year. Roughly $36.7 million of their shares were stock awards. The document, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, makes clear that the awards were related to Disney’s purchase. It calls Fox’s executive officers “critical” to the deal’s completion. The filing noted that the transaction also resulted in a significant windfall for stockholders, with stock prices spiking 75% in the 2018 fiscal year. Disney spent $71.3 billion to acquire most of the company, including the Fox movie studio, after a prolonged bidding war with Comcast. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. The Murdochs aren’t letting everything go. A “New Fox” company will include the company’s major TV channels, including Fox News, Fox Business Network, Fox broadcasting and the sports cable networks FS1 and FS2. Fox announced earlier this year that Lachlan Murdoch will become chairman and CEO of that new company, while his father serves as co-chairman.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/media/ted-turner-dementia/index.html?section=money_media|Ted Turner reveals he has Lewy body dementia|Ted Turner is battling Lewy body dementia, the CNN founder revealed in an interview that will air over the weekend. Turner told veteran newsman Ted Koppel that he has "a mild case of what people have as Alzheimer's." "It's similar to that. But not nearly as bad. Alzheimer's is fatal," Turner said in an interview for "CBS Sunday Morning." "Thank goodness I don't have that. But, I also have got, let's -- the one that's -- I can't remember the name of it." He then paused before saying, "Dementia. I can't remember what my disease is." A spokesperson for Turner confirmed the CBS report. Koppel conducted the interview, which will air this Sunday, at Turner's ranch in Montana. Turner said he feels "tired" and "exhausted" as a result of disorder. "That's the main symptoms, and, forgetfulness," he said. A true broadcasting pioneer, he led Turner Broadcasting System before launching CNN in 1980, ushering in a new era and laying the foundation for other cable news networks. In 1996, he sold CNN as well as the rest of Turner Broadcasting, to Time Warner. But his connection to the company faded in the years that followed, as he turned critical of Time Warner's doomed merger with AOL. Turner is also the chairman of Turner Enterprises, which manages his business interests in ranching and philanthropy. By 2003 he stepped down as vice chairman at AOL Time Warner, saying that the merger cost him "seven or eight billion" dollars. But his legacy at CNN continues to cast a long shadow. In 2015, Turner recorded a message for an event marking CNN's 35th anniversary. "35 years of CNN!" he said. "I can hardly believe it's been that long since we created this beloved network that has grown to be the world's most trusted news source." In the interview that will air Sunday on CBS, Turner said that he doesn't watch the news often anymore, but still checks in on the network he founded. "I think they're stickin' with politics a little too much," he said. "They'd do better to have -- a more balanced agenda. But that's, you know, just one person's opinion."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928132249-092818-ted-turner-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/media/myanmar-reuters-journalists-amal-clooney/index.html?section=money_media|Amal Clooney calls on Myanmar to pardon jailed Reuters journalists|Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney on Friday called on Myanmar officials to release two Reuters journalists who have been imprisoned since last year. Clooney represents the reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested in December and accused of exposing state secrets. They were sentenced to seven years in prison September 3. Both men pleaded not guilty. "Two innocent men are in prison in Myanmar for doing nothing more than tell the truth," Clooney said at an event held at the United Nations by the Committee to Protect Journalists. The event was intended to call attention to several cases involving journalists who have been jailed around the world, including in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan. "You don't need to take my word for it," she added. "Every single observer of this trial has agreed that it was a farce." Clooney has been representing Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo since March, but Friday marked her first public appearance related to the case. She called the story laid out by prosecutors "not only fabricated, but totally implausible." According to Reuters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained late last year while working on stories about the killings of Rohingya Muslims, a minority population in Myanmar's Rakhine state. Rohingya Muslims have fled the country in the wake of a military crackdown. Both the UN and the US have described the campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar's military has denied most of the allegations. Earlier this month, Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's de facto leader, said at the World Economic Forum in Vietnam that there were ways the refugee situation "could have been handled better," but she added that her government had attempted to ensure "development and rule of law" in the Rakhine state. In February, while the reporters were still awaiting trial, Reuters published a special investigation with their bylines. It documented a massacre of 10 Rohingya men reportedly carried out by Buddhist villagers and Myanmar troops. Reuters described the groundbreaking report as the first time that soldiers and paramilitary police had been implicated in testimony from security personnel. The families of the two men are asking for a pardon, Clooney said — a measure she described as the only way to free them. Clooney also appealed directly to Suu Kyi. The Nobel laureate was once praised for helping Myanmar transition from a military junta to semi-democracy, but her legacy has been questioned in the wake of the Rohingya crisis. "She has spoken so frequently of the need for the rule of law," Clooney said. "We are hopeful that since these are the principles she has herself espoused, that she will step in and try and correct the injustice in this case." So far, Suu Kyi has defended the government's decision. At the forum in Vietnam, she said the reporters "were not jailed because they were journalists" but for breaking the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act. "I wonder whether very many people have actually read the summary of the judgment which had nothing to do with freedom of expression at all, it had to do with the Official Secrets Act. But I don't think anybody has actually bothered to read it," Suu Kyi said, adding the two men were free to appeal the judgment. --CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this story.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928095329-reuters-myanmar-journalist-kyaw-soe-oo-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/media/late-night-ford-kavanaugh-testimony/index.html?section=money_media|How late night hosts reacted to the Christine Blasey Ford-Brett Kavanaugh hearing|Late night hosts from Jimmy Kimmel to Seth Meyers all reacted to the biggest story on Thursday: The testimonies given by Christine Blasey Ford and US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. "Millions of Americans watched the much-anticipated testimonies of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford... People were crying in front of their televisions, you would have thought Milo Ventimiglia got killed by a Crock-Pot," Kimmel said on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" -- referring a scene on NBC's "This Is Us." Kimmel said the testimony was "riveting to watch" and that Ford was "an exceptionally believable witness by all counts." "So at halftime, it seemed like the Democrats were up like 32-to-nothing," Kimmel joked. "But then Brett Kavanaugh sat down and delivered an impassioned, 45 minute speech delivered like a frat out of Hell." The host said that his testimony was loud, angry and tearful. "I haven't seen this much crying and yelling since the Cubs won the World Series," Kimmel said. Kimmel's contemporaries in late night, such as Stephen Colbert of CBS' "The Late Show," also had a lot to say about the hearing. Colbert mentioned in his monologue the comments made by Sen. Dianne Feinstein that this hearing was not a trial for Ford, but a job interview for Kavanaugh.

"I'm sorry but you're just not Arby's material. Try the Supreme Court." Colbert then showed a clip of Kavanaugh saying in his testimony that "I fear for the future."

"Yes, that's right, even people on planes were watching the hearings," Noah said. "And it was so gripping that it was first time that people were praying for a delay." He joked that even the flight attendants were watching the hearings, mimicking them telling passengers to "get your own peanuts!" NBC's Seth Meyers spent more than ten minutes giving the hearing a closer look on "Late Night." He said that Ford's testimony caught Republicans off guard.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/media/reliable-sources-09-27-18/index.html?section=money_media|Reliable Sources: Left and right reactions to the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings|A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You can sign up for free right here. Drudge is calling this "DC'S NASTIEST DAY." Breitbart is crediting Brett Kavanaugh with giving the "SPEECH OF HIS LIFE." HuffPost is billing it as the "HELL HEARING" with the "JUDGE IN THE SLUDGE." And the front page of Friday's NY Daily News is quoting Christine Blasey Ford: "100% IT WAS HIM." Did any minds change among the millions of Americans who tuned in? I don't know. I think this was a terrible day, but I don't really know what to think. So lemme point you toward some of the smartest reactions to Thursday's marathon hearing... -- CNN's Chris Cuomo: This was a "riveting and regrettable day in American history..." -- It was a "stomach-churning chapter" of history, Andrea Mitchell said on MSNBC... -- In her column for The Cut, Rebecca Traister said Ford's testimony was heroic -- "a moment so powerful that it prompted furious, admiring tears..." -- WaPo's Dan Balz: The hearing "devolved into the worst of Washington. It was a partisan brawl on steroids that will leave the country more deeply divided than before..." -- "This was men against women, right against left, a cascade of recriminations, explosions of anger, hours of tears and sobs," WaPo's Marc Fisher wrote... -- TownHall's Katie Pavlich responded and said: "Nope. There were millions of women on Kavanaugh's side today..." -- Megan McArdle tweeted: "I think the left half of the political spectrum really doesn't understand the unquenchable rage on the right at having this sprung on them at the last minute. I'm not sure the right understands the unquenchable rage that would result on the left from confirming Kavanaugh..." -- Kellyanne Conway on Laura Ingraham's show: "I think what people will ultimately remember from today is Judge Kavanaugh," not Ford... -- Douglas Brinkley on "CNN Tonight:" Kavanaugh "came off as a tool of Donald Trump..." -- My wife Jamie Stelter tweeted: "Will tomorrow be better or worse?" Friday: A 9:30 a.m. vote "The committee's going to vote in the morning and we're going to move forward," Mitch McConnell told reporters Thursday night... What this day felt like The hearing "unspooled over nearly nine hours," or "about the length of a prestige mini-series, binged Netflix-style in one wrenching, riveting sitting," the NYT's Michael Grynbaum wrote. Most people didn't watch in one sitting, though. Most people picked up bits and pieces here and there. I think it's important to keep this in mind. At the end of the day, a banner on CNN captured the fact that both witnesses cannot possibly be telling the truth. Kavanaugh said "I've never sexually assaulted anyone." And Ford said she was "100%" certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her... Ratings? In a situation like this, TV ratings can be a proxy for "impact." On Friday we'll have a sense of how many people watched Ford and how many watched Kavanaugh on TV. Already, we know this: CBS News said that Thursday was the #1 day of the year for its digital channel, CBSN, in terms of live streams. And CNN said that Thursday was CNN's biggest day of 2018 for digital video with 8 million plus live starts on its website and apps -- and more than 10 million including YouTube and Facebook streaming. This was CNN's biggest live video day since the Trump Inauguration... Comparing 1991 with 2018 Per Grynbaum's story, "network executives expected Thursday's viewership to rival the 30 million people who tuned in for another generation-defining TV event: the testimony of the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill in 1991." --> WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1991: Media has been fragmented into a million pieces... The hearing was dissected bit by bit on social media... And tech makes it really easy to stick with your tribe... "Truth is available," but... Thursday provided little in the way of new info, new evidence. "There could have been a deeper search for truth" through an FBI investigation, but Republicans leaders are stubbornly refusing to "perform the necessary due diligence," WaPo's Margaret Sullivan noted in her column. So "truth is available — just as it has been throughout the past two tumultuous years. But whether, in tribal America, truth is desirable is another matter..." More notes and quotes -- David Zurawik summing up the day: "Lots of emotion and little new information..." -- Tucker Carlson on Thursday night: "No Supreme Court nominee has spoken like this in memory. Not even Clarence Thomas. But then none has been accused more recklessly or less evidence than Brett Kavanaugh has. And he did nothing to hide his rage..." -- "Is this good?" Read NYT's Jennifer Senior on "the pain of watching Christine Blasey Ford be so accommodating to the people questioning her..." -- LAT's Matt Pearce tweeted: "It just feels like we're stripping the paint off America one layer at a time..." -- The Weekly Standard's Jonathan V. Last: "It's impossible to look at the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings and not see America as a nation in decline..." FOR THE RECORD -- "Callers from around the US flooded the lines of C-SPAN's 'Washington Journal' show on Thursday to share their own stories of sexual assault..." (Politico) -- "The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) said it had seen a jump of 147% in the number of calls" after Ford testified... (BF) -- "When the News Itself Is a Form of Trauma" -- An important piece by Julia Jacobs... (NYT) -- WaPo's Emma Brown, who had the first interview with Ford, took the occasion to remind people that "there are human beings here at The Post who read and vet tips that come in over our confidential tip line... and that sometimes, those tips turn into stories..." (Twitter) -- Oliver Darcy tweeted: "Right-wing MAGA Twitter is in love with Lindsey Graham -- which is interesting as, not long ago, the base viewed him as a squishy RINO. Quite the transformation..." (Twitter) Inside the hearing room MJ Lee was in the room for CNN. I asked her to share what the experience was like. She emailed: "I'm coming up with one cliche after another: Being in the room was an extraordinary, emotional and at times a surreal experience. It was the rare feeling that history was actually being made — the kind that you'll think about for decades — in front of my eyes. And in addition to just the largeness of the moment, there was also a kind of reporter-adrenaline high, of knowing that I had to be the eyes and ears for the network so that everything my colleagues couldn't see or feel through the three cameras in the room could be adequately chronicled. I'm hoping to go back and watch most of the hearing today soon, the way that it was aired. I'd love to know what people watching from home saw, and what I might have actually missed by being in the room. (Oh, and by watching it *without* a Tweetdeck on my computer screen moving at lightning speed.)" Morning v. afternoon There was a media world consensus about Ford's morning testimony: She was a very credible witness. The GOP's outside questioner, on the other hand, was widely criticized. After the first break, Chris Wallace said on Fox News that "this is a disaster for the Republicans." But some impressions changed over time. At the end of the day on MSNBC, Nina Totenberg described being live on NPR at midday, during a break from Ford's testimony, with "a bunch of other observers and journalists, all of whom thought, essentially, he was toast. And I reminded them that we thought Clarence Thomas was toast. And he wasn't." In the afternoon, Kavanaugh showed "you can sometimes bull your way through these things." Read more of Thursday's Reliable Sources newsletter... And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox... Case in point, Andrew Napolitano said on Fox that Kavanaugh "dug himself OUT of the hole" he was in. "He has come out swinging about as effectively as any human could." A frustrated President Trump turned optimistic, per CNN's reporting... "He feels attacked, so do they." Quoting from S.E. Cupp's column in Friday's Daily News: Kavanaugh reflected a "deep and growing anger among average Americans over what they have seen as a political hatchet job." Key line: "His frustration is theirs. He feels maligned, so do they. He feels attacked, so do they. He feels like a prop in a political game, so do they..." Conspiratorial... During Kavanaugh's testimony, Donald Trump Jr. said he loved the nominee's tone. No wonder: Kavanaugh at times sounded like an angry conservative radio host. He repeatedly made conspiratorial references to a left-wing plot. At one point Kavanaugh cited a "coordinated and well-funded effort" to destroy him. You might think this is obviously true -- or you might think this is off-the-wall conspiracy theory thinking in action... Right wing reactions: We believe her, but... Oliver Darcy emails: One of the dominant themes from the right appeared to be one that straddled both lines. Many conservative commentators on cable and Twitter said that they believe Ford was in fact assaulted, but expressed doubt that the person who assaulted her was Kavanaugh. It effectively was a way for them to avoid directly calling Ford a liar, while also allowing them the leeway to continue showing support for Kavanaugh...|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927174919-ford-sweating-in-0927-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/media/ford-kavanaugh-tv-ratings/index.html?section=money_media|Viewers gathered around the TV in high numbers for Ford-Kavanaugh hearing|Viewership was up across the board on Thursday during a marathon day of testimony by Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh. The overnight ratings showed a dramatic spike in viewership at 10 a.m. ET. Thursday, right when Ford's testimony began. Nearly 20% of US households with televisions were watching the hearings at any given time between 10 a.m. and 6:45 p.m., according to Nielsen ratings. That percentage is an average, which means an even greater number of homes watched some part of the proceedings. Between 10 and 6:45, Fox News averaged 5.66 million viewers at any given time, MSNBC averaged 2.83 million and CNN averaged 2.51 million viewers. All of those totals are two to three times higher than a typical day. CNN saw a bigger surge of young viewers than MSNBC did. In the 25- to 54-year-old demographic, CNN averaged 730,000 while MSNBC had 461,000. Fox News averaged 1.06 million. Interest remained high all day long, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening hours when Kavanaugh defended himself amid questioning by Democratic senators. Viewership rose by several hundred thousand viewers each for CNN and MSNBC when Kavanaugh testified. At Fox News, where opinion hosts have been championing his nomination for months, the spike was more pronounced. Fox averaged 4.69 million viewers during Ford's hours and 7.17 million during Kavanaugh's hours. The Senate hearing was also shown live on the NBC, ABC and CBS broadcast networks. Detailed ratings are not yet available for those networks. The Nielsen data only includes viewership via traditional TV. An untold number of others tuned in to the testimony through radio and streaming video, and at public viewing events. CBS News said that Thursday was the No. 1 day of the year for its digital channel, CBSN, in terms of live streams. And CNN said that Thursday was its biggest day of 2018 for digital video with 8.2 million plus live starts on its website and apps -- and more than 10 million including YouTube and Facebook streaming. It amounted to CNN's biggest live video day since the Trump inauguration, according to a network spokeswoman. There is no precise way to compare Thursday's viewership to the three days of hearings involving Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill in 1991 because there was only one cable news channel back then, and no internet. But reporters across the country described scenes reminiscent of 1991: People gathering around TV's in public places and catching parts of the hearings at work, at restaurants, and in airports.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928112804-usc-kavanaugh-testimony-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/media/fox-news-fires-contributor-kavanaugh-hearing/index.html?section=money_media|Fox News fires contributor over tweets during Kavanaugh hearing|Fox News has fired contributor Kevin Jackson for his tweets about Brett Kavanaugh's accusers. Jackson used a pejorative to refer to the three women who have accused the Supreme Court nominee of inappropriate behavior. Jackson said Thursday on Twitter that the women were not to be believed, then referred to them using a demeaning word. "TO HELL with the notion that women must be believed no matter what," he said. Kevin Jackson is a conservative radio talk show host and author about black culture in the United States. He had been a Fox News contributor since 2014. Fox News said his tweets were inappropriate. "Kevin Jackson has been terminated as a contributor," a company spokesperson said in a statement. "His comments on today's hearings were reprehensible and do not reflect the values of Fox News." Jackson did not respond to a request for comment. His dismissal comes after Fox's daytime journalists and commentators highlighted Christine Blasey Ford's credibility at Thursday's hearing, before praising Kavanaugh's testimony as persuasive. "I think we're probably, at the moment, back to where we were before the hearing started," Fox commentator Brit Hume said after hearing from both Ford and Kavanaugh. "I think the scales have been rebalanced." All three of the network's prime time hosts — Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham — have cast doubt on the claims against Kavanaugh and expressed support for his nomination. — CNN's Brian Stelter contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180220005949-fox-news-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/media/christine-blasey-ford-fox-news/index.html?section=money_media|How Fox News is covering Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony|The White House says President Trump is watching Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh's testimony. If he's been watching on his favorite network, Fox News, he may be surprised. Rather than defending Kavanaugh at all costs, like the network's prime time hosts have been doing, Fox's daytime journalists and commentators highlighted Ford's credibility and humanity on display at Thursday's hearing. "I think Dr. Ford is exceptionally credible," Fox's top legal analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano, said. "A lot of folks" are "viewing her as a very credible witness," Supreme Court correspondent and 11 p.m. anchor Shannon Bream said. After the first break at Thursday's hearing, "Fox News Sunday" moderator Chris Wallace said "this is a disaster for the Republicans." The assessments on Fox echoed what was being said up and down the TV channel lineup. The NBC, ABC and CBS broadcast networks are all carrying the Senate hearing wall-to-wall, preempting hours of daytime programming. All the cable news networks are also live. But the tone of the TV discussions -- on Fox and elsewhere -- shifted after Kavanaugh's angry opening statement. He came out "guns blazing," Fox anchor Martha MacCallum said. She said that when she interviewed Kavanaugh on Monday, it was like he had "a cork in." Now, "it feels like the cork got pulled out." Fox commentator Britt Hume said Ford's testimony was "so impressive in its own way," but Kavanaugh was also persuasive. "I think we're probably, at the moment, back to where we were before the hearing started," Hume said after hearing from both Ford and Kavanaugh. "I think the scales have been rebalanced." Wallace said Kavanaugh managed to "match the emotion" and the raw moments of Ford's testimony. Earlier in the day, Wallace had expressed criticism of the GOP's outside counsel Rachel Mitchell for "treating this like a deposition, like a court hearing," while questioning Ford. But commentators on Fox gave Mitchell higher marks for her questioning of Kavanaugh in the afternoon. Given Trump's tight relationship with Fox, there had been a lot of curiosity about how the network would frame Thursday's hearing. All three of the network's prime time hosts -- Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham -- have cast doubt on the claims against Kavanaugh and expressed support for his nomination in many different ways. "What you are witnessing is one of the ugliest smear campaigns in history," Hannity said Wednesday night. It remains to be seen what those hosts will say after the hearing. But Fox's daytime coverage was led by MacCallum and Bret Baier, the network's two top political anchors. During the lunchtime break on Capitol Hill, some conservative Fox commentators, like Hume, emphasized that Ford's allegations are "uncorroborated." But there was also ample conversation about the #MeToo context and the cultural implications of the hearing. "We are in a different place today than we were with Clarence Thomas," liberal commentator Marie Harf said. Fox News, of course, was rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal within its walls two years ago. Fox News boss Roger Ailes was forced out after numerous allegations of harassment and assault were lodged against him. During a break in the Ford testimony, Napolitano said, "The president cannot be happy with this." But later, during Kavanaugh's turn, Napolitano had a more positive perspective for Republicans. Napolitano said he thought that the nominee's angry and tearful comments were "normal, natural and people expect it." As for the testimony, "quite frankly," he said, "it's riveting."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927131026-19-ford-senate-hearing-0927-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/media/sky-fox-comcast-disney-shares/index.html?section=money_media|Comcast takes Sky: Fox and Disney agree to sell stake in European broadcaster|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on September 26, 2018. London CNN Business — Comcast is getting all of Sky. 21st Century Fox announced Wednesday that it would sell its 39% stake in Sky to Comcast, which won majority control of the European broadcaster in a dramatic auction over the weekend. Disney, which had backed Fox in the auction, said it had consented to the sale. “In light of the premium Comcast has agreed to pay for Sky, we and Disney have decided to sell 21CF’s existing 39% holding in Sky to Comcast,” Fox said in a statement. “We congratulate Comcast on their pending acquisition.” Comcast outbid Fox and Disney on Saturday in a rare auction for most of Sky (SKYAY) that was administered by the UK Takeover Panel. The US media company’s final bid was £17.28 ($22.65) per share, valuing Sky at £30.6 billion ($40.1 billion). That was over 25% more than its previous offer of £14.75 ($19.43) per share. The sale marks the end of an era for Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch, who had repeatedly sought to gain full control of Sky. Fox’s latest takeover attempt faced lengthy delays as UK regulators investigated whether Fox would be a “fit and proper” owner and whether full control of Sky would give Murdoch’s family too much control over UK media. The battle took on added significance earlier this year when Disney outbid Comcast for a big chunk of Fox’s assets including its existing stake in Sky. Disney CEO Bob Iger lost out to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts in the tussle for Sky. Photo Illustration: Getty Images / CNNMoney Attention then turned to the battle for the remaining 61% of Sky. On one side of the fight was Fox (FOX) and its backer Disney (DIS). On the other was Comcast (CMCSA), which swooped in with an offer for Sky in February. Both Comcast and Fox wanted to add Sky to their portfolios to help them compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. Sky is a leader in pay TV in the United Kingdom and other markets including Germany and Italy. It also sells broadband and mobile phone services. Disney said in a statement on Wednesday that it would use the proceeds from the sale of its Sky stake to help pay for the Fox purchase. The sale should raise roughly $15 billion. “The sale of Fox’s Sky holdings will substantially reduce the cost of our overall acquisition and allow us to aggressively invest in building and creating high-quality content for our direct-to-consumer platforms to meet the growing demands of viewers,” Disney CEO Robert Iger said. Disney said it plans to expand and invest in streaming services including Hulu, in which it will soon own a 60% stake. The other major investor in Hulu is Comcast, which owns 30%. Comcast declined to comment on Wednesday.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180726163707-sky-hq-entrance.jpg?q=x_0,y_116,h_1406,w_2500,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/25/media/att-xandr-advertising/index.html?section=money_media|AT&T, fresh off its WarnerMedia deal, unveils new advertising business|AT&T introduced a new advertising business on Tuesday that seeks to disrupt Google and Facebook's tight grip on the industry. The division has a new name, Xandr, and a mandate to create a marketplace for targeted TV and online video advertising. The idea, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said, is that "if you can make the premium video side operate and behave more like the digital side, people will invest more and be excited about the advertising model on that side." In the not-too-distant future, according to AT&T's pitch, TV ads on channels like CNN will be tailored to the viewer who is watching, so a mom with kids will see different messages than a college student. Numerous other companies are also working on so-called addressable TV advertising. AT&T is unique because it owns a basket of cable channels, through its recent acquisition of Time Warner, and it has a huge number of customer relationships through its wireless division. Time Warner, now renamed WarnerMedia, includes CNN, TNT, HBO, and other brands. "We have data. We have great content. We have direct-to-consumer distribution. and we have technology," Xandr CEO Brian Lesser said. Lesser, who joined AT&T a year ago to launch this advertising division, revealed the new name while on stage at a conference on Tuesday. The name Xandr is a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, the founder of the phone company that eventually became AT&T. Lesser said his goal is a "premium marketplace" for buying ads on TV and the web. In the media industry, there's been a lot of curiosity about AT&T's plans because Google and Facebook have become known as the "digital duopoly," gaining market power at the expense of other players. Lesser's argument, reiterated on stage Tuesday, is that a robust advertising business is necessary to fund TV production -- to "fuel the great content being developed." Improving the state of TV advertising was one of the tentpoles of the Time Warner acquisition, which took effect in June. "So far so good," Stephenson said when interviewed by CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday morning. Stephenson said that WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey is working on plans for increased investments at HBO, one of the flagship brands within the portfolio. Stephenson followed up on his recent comments that Netflix is akin to Walmart while HBO is akin to Tiffany. He said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon "called me the next day," wanting to know what he meant. "They're a really big customer," Stephenson said as the audience chuckled. "Look, if I am going to go shop for something, whatever it is, I want to go one place," Stephenson said, referring to Walmart and Netflix. As a streaming service, Netflix has amassed an enormous amount of content. But HBO's brand is about being the "premium" option, he said, citing "Game of Thrones" as an example. At the same time, he said AT&T wants to ensure that "there's always something new and fresh on HBO," thereby reducing the number of people who unsubscribe and resubscribe to the service. "I think we should aspire to everyday engagement on these platforms," he told Harlow. Stephenson also asserted that the media world is "averse and reluctant to change" when it comes to new ways of doing business. "It's fascinating to me," he told Harlow. "You think of media and entertainment, and how it moves fast, but in terms of business models and changing how you deliver the product, it is an industry that has about as much inertia as any industry I've been involved in." He cited past experience with companies like Boeing. He said media is "a very slow moving industry," and he made clear that he'd like to accelerate it.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925175955-randall-stephenson-march-22-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/media/richard-parsons-cbs/index.html?section=money_media|Richard Parsons named 'interim chairman' of CBS board|Richard Parsons, who joined the CBS board earlier this year, is now the board's "interim chairman." The move, announced Tuesday evening, was unanimously approved by the board of directors. "I think I speak for all Board members when I say I look forward to learning more about CBS' compelling opportunities and how we can help guide and support the company's growth," Parsons said in a statement. Shari Redstone, whose company National Amusements has the controlling stake in CBS, played a pivotal role in bringing Parsons to CBS. Redstone is consolidating her power now that longtime CBS CEO Les Moonves has stepped down. Moonves and Redstone were locked in a power struggle earlier this year. Moonves exited the company after two stories by The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow alleged incidents of sexual misconduct in his past. Moonves called the allegations "untrue" and suggested that the claims were coming up "as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career." His exit on September 9 coincided with the settlement of the litigation between CBS and Redstone. The board was also reshaped at that time. And the changes continued on Tuesday. Two veteran board members, Bruce Gordon and William Cohen, stepped down, according to the announcement. According to The New York Times, both men supported Moonves after Farrow's first story came out. James B. Stewart's story in The Times opened with a quote, attributed to Cohen, staunchly defending Moonves: "We are going to stay in this meeting until midnight if we need to until we get an agreement that we stand 100 percent behind our C.E.O., and there will be no change in his status." According to Stewart's story, Gordon was also initially "opposed" to suspending Moonves.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925213242-dick-parsons-may-2018-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/24/media/tiger-woods-ratings/index.html?section=money_media|Tiger Woods' victory came with ratings spike for NBC|Tiger Woods' first victory in five years on Sunday came with a huge ratings boost. NBC's coverage of the Tour Championship earned a 5.2 overnight rating. That's a spike of 206% over last year's tournament. Sunday's final round was the highest-rated telecast in the history of the FedExCup Playoffs since its inception in 2007. It was also the highest-rated PGA Tour telecast of 2018, excluding the four major championships, which are The Masters, the US Open, the British Open and the PGA Championship. Nielsen takes the percentage of households watching in 56 US markets and comes up with an overnight average. That means that 5.2% of households in these 56 markets tuned into Woods' win, his 80th overall, on Sunday. NBC's coverage peaked at a 7.19 rating as Woods finished his round, ending his long victory drought. "Tiger Woods' win at the Tour Championship was an unforgettable event in golf," said Mike McCarley, President of golf for the NBC Sports Group. "The massive gallery following Tiger up the 18th fairway was matched by record viewership across NBC Sports' platforms." Related: Golf wins with Tiger Woods back at the Masters Woods entered this year still one of the most popular and most watched names in golf, despite not having a victory since 2013.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/investing/markets-now-investing-defense/index.html?section=money_markets|Why it’s time for investors to go on defense|CNN — It’s time for investors to start making safer bets. That’s what Howard Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, told CNNMoney editor-at-large Richard Quest on “Markets Now” on Wednesday. “Defense is more important than offense” right now, said Marks, the author of “Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side.” Investors should consider taking a stake in utilities, and decreasing their investments in more volatile tech stocks, he said. Defense is the name of the game for a few reasons. Though stocks have been soaring, Marks warned that we may be nearing the end of the bull cycle. “I’m not saying get out,” he said. “I think that being out of the market is pretty dangerous today, and I think it would be a mistake to raise cash.” But more reliable stocks can protect investors from big losses if the climate changes. Marks also pointed to the trade war with China as another reason for investors to tread carefully. “We have a trade battle with China, it’s probably going to get solved, but it may go off the rails,” he said. “And if it goes off the rails, it has very serious consequences for the world economy.” CNNMoney's "Markets Now" streams live from the NYSE every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/04/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html?section=money_markets|7 things to know before the bell|1. The race to driverless cars: SoftBank SFTBF Toyota TM SoftBank will own just over half of Monet, the new business, while Toyota will hold the rest. It's the latest in a series of driverless development partnerships announced by tech companies and carmakers. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, its tech-focused investment arm, had already committed $2.3 billion to General Motors' self-driving car unit GM Cruise. On Wednesday, Honda (HMC) and General Motors (GM) said they were teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles. BMW (BMWYY) has joined the board of Apollo, an autonomous driving project from Chinese internet firm Baidu (BIDU). 2. Facebook under investigation: The Irish Data Protection Commission has launched a formal probe into a Facebook (FB) hack that affected as many as 50 million accounts. The commission will investigate whether the company complied with its obligations under new European data protection laws that came into effect in May. Facebook said last week that it closed the loophole, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. Irish regulators are investigating because Facebook's international headquarters is in Dublin. There are still many unanswered questions about the hack: Who carried it out? And what were they trying to access? 3. Bonds sell-off: The yield on 10-year US Treasuries has spiked to the highest level in seven years following the release of positive economic data. US hiring data published Wednesday was stronger than expected, and momentum could continue Thursday if initial claims numbers add to the optimism. A strong US economy and the expectation of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are fueling the trend. "The underlying message is that the US economy isn't just in fine fettle, it's on fire," said Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale. 4. CNN means business: On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business, covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward. This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind. 5.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/news/companies/barnes-and-noble-sale/index.html?section=money_markets|Barnes & Noble stock soars 20% as it explores a sale|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on October 3, 2018. New York CNN Business — Barnes & Noble stock jumped more than 20% after the board said it would consider a sale of the troubled company. The board said Wednesday it had appointed a special committee to review offers. One came from longtime Barnes & Noble chairman Len Riggio. He is the company’s largest shareholder, controlling close to 20%. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also disclosed that a shareholder it could not identify had rapidly built up a stake in the company. To block a hostile takeover, Barnes & Noble’s board of directors approved what’s known as a poison pill. The poison pill will kick in if the unidentified party accumulates 20% of the stock or more. At that point, shareholders will be allowed to buy Barnes & Noble’s stock at a 50% discount, diluting the value of the shares. The announcement comes shortly after another investor disclosed a stake of close to 7%, and said he had held talks with Riggio about buying the company. The board said Riggio would vote his shares in favor of any transaction recommended by the committee. A potential sale is just the latest twist in the saga of Barnes & Noble, which is looking to replace its fifth chief executive in as many years. The bookstore fired its most recent CEO, Demos Parneros, in early July, citing unspecified violations of company policy. Barnes & Noble later revealed that claims of sexual harassment and bullying led to Parneros’ termination. In August, Parneros sued his former employer in federal court for defamation and for firing him without cause. Barnes & Noble still has more 600 stores and 23,000 employees. Last quarter, same-store sales dropped 6.1% compared with a year ago. Sales have fallen at Barnes & Noble during each of the past four years. New tactics, such as smaller store formats and a kitchen concept, have struggled to win back shoppers. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in September that most of the stores “feel tired, are too large and too cluttered, and do not offer the consumer any compelling reason to visit and buy.” He believes Barnes & Noble will shutter more stores: “Barnes & Noble needs to slim down in order to survive.” Barnes & Noble’s problems come as local and independent bookstores are resurgent. The American Booksellers Association, a trade group, reported that the number of independent locations rose 6% last year to 2,470.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181003165900-barnes-and-noble-strategic-review.jpg?q=x_61,y_0,h_1347,w_2394,c_crop/w_800

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/investing/aston-martin-ipo/index.html?section=money_markets|Aston Martin falls 5% in London IPO|Aston Martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an IPO that values the British company at more than $5 billion. But its first day of trading in London got off to a rocky start. The favorite carmaker of fictional British secret service agent James Bond priced its shares at £19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion). The final listing price is 16% below the top of the range that Aston Martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as Italian rival Ferrari. Shares dipped nearly 5% in London trading. In going public, the British company is asking investors to overcome fears about US threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for Britain's planned exit from the European Union to disrupt supply chains and markets. Aston Martin, which has a history of bankruptcy filings, is now producing healthy profits. It sold more than 5,000 cars in 2017, its best performance in nine years. That generated record revenue of £876 million ($1.1 billion), an increase of nearly 50% over the previous year. Earnings for the first half of this year show that momentum has continued. Revenue was up 8% over the same period a year earlier, while profit increased 14%, according to the numbers that were published last month. Aston Martin has in recent years sought to capitalize on its high-end brand. But analysts at Bernstein see several potential problems. They argue the Aston Martin brand is not as strong as that of Ferrari (RACE), which is bolstered by decades of racing history and a slew of Formula 1 championships. The British automaker also has much tighter margins than its Italian rival and a worrying history of uneven sales. With money raised from the IPO earmarked for existing shareholders rather than investment in the company, Aston Martin executives could be pinning too much hope on the success of a planned SUV. "Given its current financials and apparently rather less robust demand, it's a big stretch for us to see how it can possibly match Ferrari's profitability," analysts at Bernstein wrote recently. "We can't see it getting anywhere close." Aston Martin's owners include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DDAIF), private equity firm Investindustrial and investors based in Kuwait.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/181003093346-01-aston-martin-lse-1003-restricted-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/jcpenney-jill-soltau-ceo-joann/index.html?section=money_markets|JCPenney names Jill Soltau as its new CEO|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on October 2, 2018. New York CNN Business — Jill Soltau, a veteran retail leader most recently in charge of Joann fabric and craft stores, will be tasked with turning around JCPenney. The company announced on Tuesday that Soltau will take over as its chief executive beginning on October 15. JCPenney has been leaderless since Marvin Ellison left in May to take the top job at Lowe’s. Soltau, 51, will be the 25th woman currently leading a Fortune 500 company, according to Fortune magazine. She will become Penney’s fifth chief executive in the past decade. She will make a base salary of $1.4 million, with a $6 million signing bonus and will be eligible for annual performance-based bonuses. In a sign that Soltau has Wall Street’s approval to start, shares rose 10% in extended trading. Soltau will face a daunting task: turning around JCPenney (JCP), a former retail heavyweight that has fallen more than 50% this year and slipped to close to $1.50 a share. Penney is currently without its chief financial officer. Jeffrey Davis resigned last week only 14 months after taking the job. The challenges at JCPenney are enormous. It is more than $4 billion in debt and has posted a profit in only two quarters during the past four years. Penney lost $101 million in its most recent quarter. JCPenney’s decline comes at a moment when rival department stores Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl’s (KSS) and Macy’s (M) have demonstrated an ability to reinvent their businesses for the digital shopping era. Soltau will have to make tough decisions about Penney’s store footprint. The company has 860 stores and hundreds of them are in struggling malls. JCPenney also has a glut of clothing piling up at its warehouses and stores. Penney has been searching for a leader with merchandising experience to help it make better decisions about which brands to sell in stores. “We wanted someone with rich apparel and merchandising experience and found Jill to be an ideal fit,” board director Paul Brown said in a news release. Soltau took over at Joann in 2015. She has also held positions at Shopko, Sears, and Kohl’s. Penney selecting Soltau signals the company wants to break from Ellison’s strategy. Ellison was a former Home Depot executive and led Penney into the appliance business. But his tenure had mixed results: Washers and dryers were not major draws for customers and its clothing assortment suffered. Penney believes its core shoppers are middle-aged women. Earlier this month, Penney introduced Artesia, a new women’s chic brand for less than $30.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002163310-jill-soltau.jpg?q=x_222,y_267,h_995,w_1768,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/tesla-sales/index.html?section=money_markets|Tesla calms fears with strong sales numbers|New York CNN Business — A tumultuous quarter at Tesla ended with some very good sales numbers. The company delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter, a strong performance that should calm investor fears about logistical problems and a looming cash crunch. That included almost 56,000 of the lower-priced Model 3. Production was a bit below that number: Tesla said it built about 53,000 Model 3s. But that was within the company’s projections. Only three months ago, the company struggled to build 5,000 Model 3s in a week, a long-delayed target. Tesla did not maintain that pace, but production was still high enough to keep the company on track to turn a sustained profit for the first time. Tesla was sorely in need of good news. In August, CEO Elon Musk proposed, then abandoned, plans to take the company private. The SEC sued Musk last week, claiming he had deceived investors by claiming in a tweet that he had secured financing to go private. On Saturday, the second to last day of the quarter, Musk reached a deal with the SEC to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as chairman of Tesla. He will remain as CEO, news that relieved Wall Street on Monday. Executives have also left the company in recent months, including the chief accounting officer, who quit after less than a month on the job. Tesla (TSLA) stock closed down about 3% following the production and sales report. Tesla will release revenue and profit numbers later in the quarter. The report did not give details on where those figures would come in. It did say that all Model 3s sold at the end of the quarter were the more expensive all-wheel-drive models, powered by dual electric motors. Musk also sent an email to all Tesla employees over the weekend saying that the company was close to its goal of being profitable. “We are very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong, but, to be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow (Sunday),” he wrote, referring to the last day of the quarter. “If we go all out tomorrow, we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations.” The company has reported only two quarters of modest profits in its 10-year history. It has reported a total of $6 billion in losses during that time. Tesla has $1.2 billion in debt maturing within the next six months, which has prompted some analysts to project the company would need to sell additional shares or debt to raise cash. Musk has said revenue from sales would give Tesla the cash it needs. But he also has admitted that the company has run into problems delivering its cars. That added to investor concerns about a cash crunch. Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2018 “Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell,” Musk tweeted two weeks ago to a customer who inquired when a promised car would be delivered. “This problem is far more tractable,” he added. “We’re making rapid progress.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002133235-01-tesla-model-3-1002-restricted.jpg?q=x_3,y_218,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/investing/general-electric-downgrade-debt/index.html?section=money_markets|S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital|New York CNN Business — New General Electric boss Larry Culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he’s inheriting. Barely 24 hours after Culp became CEO, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of GE (GE) and GE Capital. Moody’s and Fitch warned they could do the same. All three ratings firms cited GE’s elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows – an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at GE’s power division. GE said on Monday that plunging profit at GE Power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018. S&P pointed to “deep near-term challenges” at GE Power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy. More recently, GE disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines. Culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider CEO in GE’s history. But at the top of the list must be repairing GE’s once-sturdy balance sheet. GE had a perfect AAA credit rating as recently as 2009. S&P lowered it on Tuesday from “A” to “BBB+”. Over the years, GE has piled on tons of debt caused by poorly-timed deals, a massive pension deficit and misguided share buybacks. Underscoring the scale of the problem, Moody’s said that GE’s “very elevated leverage” could lead it to downgrade the company’s rating by multiple notches. Ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money. The good news is that S&P updated its outlook on GE to “stable” because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years. Still, GE’s debt problems may force the company to reexamine its $4.2 billion dividend. GE cut the dividend last year for just the second time since the Great Depression. But GE’s finances have deteriorated further. S&P listed the dividend as one of several levers Culp could pull to reduce debt. In a statement, GE said it has a “sound liquidity position” that includes cash and operating credit lines. Repeating comments made by Culp on Monday, GE said it remains “committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging.” Now that he’s in charge, Culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former CEO John Flannery’s plans to break-up GE. Flannery’s turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division. Proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt. But shrinking GE also makes the company more dependent on the rest of its portfolio – with GE Power being the biggest remaining business. That means slumping power profit gives GE less firepower to pay down debt.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002143128-100218-ge-underwater.jpg?q=x_0,y_200,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html?section=money_markets|Amazon announces $15 minimum wage for all US employees|New York CNN Business — Amazon is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all US employees. The change takes effect November 1 and applies to full-time, part-time and temporary workers. Amazon (AMZN) says the $15 minimum wage will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees, plus 100,000 seasonal workers. “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and CEO. “We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.” The change applies to Whole Foods and all other subsidiary employees. Amazon also said its public policy team will begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. “We’ll leave it to Congress and professionals to decide what the right number is,” Dave Clark, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, told CNN’s Christine Romans. “But for us, that number is $15.” The size and explosive growth of Amazon give the decision importance far beyond the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit directly. Amazon is among the largest employers in the United States, and it has added more American jobs in the past decade than any other company. The decision also raises the stakes for potential workers at Amazon’s next headquarters. The company is planning to create a second headquarters, known as HQ2, with as many as 50,000 jobs. Amazon has named 20 cities as finalists, including Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. Critics, including independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have said that Amazon does not pay workers enough. They have drawn a contrast with Bezos’ spectacular wealth: He is the richest person alive, worth an estimated $165 billion. “I want to give credit where credit is due,” Sanders said on Tuesday. “I want to congratulate Mr. Bezos for doing exactly the right thing.” He said he looked forward to working with Bezos to push for a $15 federal minimum. Bezos responded by thanking the senator. “We’re excited about this, and also hope others will join in,” he wrote in a tweet. Thank you @SenSanders. We’re excited about this, and also hope others will join in. https://t.co/kasWkkOhWo — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) October 2, 2018 Workers across the country have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, most notably as part of the movement known as Fight for $15. Supporters say it’s a remedy for widening wage inequality and will boost consumer spending, while opponents counter that it could reduce opportunities for employment, particularly for teenagers and others looking for entry level or low-skilled jobs. Some companies have responded to the public pressure. Target raised its minimum wage for new hires to $12 an hour in September and plans to raise its minimum to $15 by the end of 2020. Disney reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of $15 an hour at Disneyland in California in 2019 and at Disney World in Florida by 2021. And Walmart, the country’s largest private-sector employer, which has more than 1 million US workers, raised its minimum wage to $11 in February. Clark said that Amazon wanted to make its change sooner. “We decided, why wait? We should really do this now,” he told Romans. Paul Sonn, state policy program director for the National Employment Law Project, said Amazon’s announcement would put pressure on other companies to raise pay, and on Congress to lift the national minimum. Twenty-nine states have their own minimum wages higher than the federal $7.25. Neil Saunders, managing director of the consultancy GlobalData Retail, said that higher minimum pay could also help Amazon recruit workers. “Without a rise in wages, Amazon would be placing itself at a disadvantage in the labor market,” Saunders said. The company’s rapid growth requires “a lot of recruitment which is becoming increasingly difficult in a tight labor market,” he said. “This is especially so over the holiday season.” Saunders added that the decision was “politically savvy.” Last month, Amazon said that the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in its fulfillment centers was already more than $15 per hour. Amazon median pay last year was $28,446, according to a company filing. That comes to $13.68 an hour. The company noted that the figure includes international and part-time employees. The company also announced that it is increasing the minimum wage for UK employees starting November 1. The new minimum wage is £10.50 ($13.60) for the London area and £9.50 ($12.30) for the rest of the country. More than 37,000 employees, including seasonal workers, will be affected by the change. The current UK minimum wage for adults over 25 is £7.83 ($10.15).|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002120011-02-us-amazon-employees-file-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_150,h_1688,w_3000,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/volkswagen-audi-rupert-stadler/index.html?section=money_markets|Volkswagen dumps jailed Audi CEO amid emissions probe|London CNN — Volkswagen has severed ties with suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who has been jailed since June in connection with an emissions investigation. Stadler has left the board of management of Audi parent company Volkswagen (VLKAF) and stepped down as chairman of the premium brand’s management board, the autos group said in a statement Tuesday. “Due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense,” the statement said of Stadler. Munich prosecutors said in June that Stadler, who has worked for Volkswagen since 1990, had been detained because of concerns he could influence witnesses in an ongoing investigation. He is the highest ranking Volkswagen executive to be arrested in connection to a costly diesel emissions scandal that burst into public view in 2015. Volkswagen previously said that Stadler would be considered innocent until proven guilty. Audi tapped its top sales executive to lead the company after Stadler was detained. The German carmaker has admitted that it rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests. Diesel cars from Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary cheated on clean air rules with software that made emissions look less toxic than they actually were. The scandal sent its share price plunging, and trashed confidence among consumer and regulators in diesel technology. The episode has already cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in recalls, legal penalties and settlements. In a separate announcement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would offer incentives to customers in Germany who wanted to swap older diesel cars for cleaner models. Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive officer of Volkswagen, was indicted by US prosecutors in May. He was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud American customers and violate the Clean Air Act. Matthias Mueller, who was brought in to replace Winterkorn, stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by BMW (BMWYY) veteran Herbert Diess. Diess acknowledged at a press conference in April that Volkswagen had “lost a great deal of trust,” and that it would take years to restore public confidence in the automaker.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002113657-01-rupert-stadler-file.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/news/companies/goldman-sachs-kevin-hassett-trump/index.html?section=money_markets|Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says|New York CNN Business — Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. The Goldman Sachs economics team “almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition,” Hassett told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Tuesday. The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019. Hassett said he hadn’t read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman’s track record. Hassett claimed its analysis of last year’s tax cuts was “really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way.” He said Goldman’s analysis predicted the tax cuts would be “really harmful” to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed. “So maybe they’re just trying to make a partisan point before the elections,” said Hassett, chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Keep in mind that Goldman Sachs (GS), like other investment banks, charges clients to access their economic and market insights. Investors rely on that research to be nonpartisan. Goldman Sachs declined to comment about the criticism. It marks another chapter in Team Trump’s love-hate relationship with Goldman Sachs, the most powerful firm on Wall Street. Trump blasted Goldman Sachs during the 2016 presidential campaign. He claimed Goldman Sachs had “total, total control” over his rivals Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. Trump’s closing campaign ad flashed an image of Lloyd Blankfein, then the CEO of Goldman Sachs, as the candidate’s narration condemned the “global power structure” for robbing America’s working class. After the election, Trump reversed course. He named former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin to the powerful role of Treasury secretary. Trump hired Gary Cohn, a registered Democrat who was then president of Goldman Sachs, to be the face of his economic team. (Cohn left earlier this year because of a disagreement over trade.) In the 2016 race, Clinton received $388,426 from individuals at Goldman Sachs, more than any other candidate, according to OpenSecrets. Trump received $5,607, according to OpenSecrets. Then again, Goldman Sachs employees contributed more to Republicans than Democrats overall in 2016 federal races. Blankfein backed Clinton in the election. However, after the election, Blankfein gave Trump credit for the soaring American economy. “If the president didn’t win, and Hillary Clinton won … I bet you the economy is higher today than it otherwise would be,” Blankfein told CNN in February. Veterans of Goldman Sachs have gone on to work in Republican and Democratic administrations. Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, served as Treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton. Hank Paulson had been the chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs before leading the Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush during the 2008 financial crisis.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002105430-100218-kevin-hassett.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/ge-ceo-larry-culp-flannery/index.html?section=money_markets|Meet GE’s new boss: Can Larry Culp right the ship?|New York CNN Business — General Electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create. Larry Culp, 55, is a proven leader known for his hands-on approach. He received a hero’s welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE’s new boss. GE’s (GE) beaten-down share price spiked 10%. Culp, who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just 37, faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness. The iconic maker of light bulbs, MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals, needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt. Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE’s market value over the past 18 years. That’s roughly the size of Facebook (FB). GE, a company that prides itself on management excellence, is so desperate that for the first time in its 126-year history it is being led by an outsider. “GE has been like watching a slow (but fatal) train wreck,” Scott Davis, lead analyst at Melius Research, wrote to clients on Monday. “Unwinding 15 years of bad decisions will require courage,” but Davis added: “I wouldn’t want to bet against Larry.” Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood, GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery, a 30-year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp. “GE should be commended for selecting a credible, seasoned GE outsider,” Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients. Culp is likely to “more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be.” Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between 2001 and 2015. The company’s revenue and market cap quintupled over that time. It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited.” Jeff Sonnenfeld, Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses. He pushed Danaher into health care, a business that today sells tools, lights and software used by dentists. “He’s got the chops to take over a company of this size,” said Jim Corridore, an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research. ‘Disturbing’ writedown Khanna cheered Culp’s history of “prudent” capital allocation at Danaher, noting that roughly $25 billion was deployed during his tenure. After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt, GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources. Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low. Consider the disastrous 2015 purchase of Alstom, a $9.5 billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time. GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to $23 billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired. “The size of the writedown is disturbing,” said Corridore. Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year. While he deserves credited for disclosing “dirty laundry” he uncovered, Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders. “It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited,” said Jeff Sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management. In a statement, Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent. “Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors. His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE’s needs,” Immelt said. Will GE continue its makeover? Now, Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery’s turnaround plan. Culp joined GE’s board in April, meaning he signed off on Flannery’s push to remake the company around power, its booming aviation business and renewable energy. The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care, railroad, light bulb and oil-and-gas businesses – and use the proceeds to pay down debt. Given Culp’s history in health care at Danaher, Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division. GE’s vast corporate structure, built up over decades by Immelt and Welch, could get slimmed-down under Culp. Culp ran Danaher with less than 100 employees in the corporate office, and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely “strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms.” Tall challenge ahead But cost-cutting alone won’t fix GE. Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power. Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy, but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems. GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates. And then there’s the ghost of GE Capital, the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis. Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines, such as WMC Mortgage, the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department. Elsewhere at GE Capital, Culp needs to stabilize the long-term care insurance portfolio that suffered a $6 billion loss in January. The news prompted an SEC investigation – the second GE is currently facing. By hiring Culp, GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street. But don’t be fooled: righting the ship will take much longer.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001141200-100118-lary-culp-ge-ceo-gfx.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/business/tesla-stock/index.html?section=money_markets|Tesla stock roars back after Elon Musk’s SEC deal|New York CNN Business — Investors cheered Tesla’s deal with the SEC that keeps Elon Musk as CEO. The stock surged 17% on Monday, more than wiping away Friday’s loss. Over the weekend, Musk agreed to a settlement with the SEC that requires him to step down as Tesla’s chairman and pay a $20 million fine. Under the settlement, which requires court approval, Musk will be allowed to stay as CEO but must leave his role as chairman of the board within 45 days. He cannot seek reelection for three years, according to court filings. He accepted the deal “without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint,” according to a court document. Separately, Tesla (TSLA) agreed Saturday to pay $20 million to settle claims it failed to adequately police Musk’s tweet. Last week, the government charged Musk with making “false and misleading statements” to investors on his Twitter account when he said he had secured funding to take the company private. Besides the settlement news, Tesla has another milestone this week. It is set to release third quarter production numbers that will show whether the production level it reached at the end of the second quarter — when it produced 5,000 Model 3 cars a week -— was a blip or sustainable.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001075430-01-elon-musk-chicago-file.jpg?q=x_3,y_267,h_1698,w_3017,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/investing/stock-market-today-usmca-ge-tesla-dow/index.html?section=money_markets|Stocks pop after new US-Canada-Mexico deal|New York CNN Business — The stock market appears to like the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Stocks popped after all three countries agreed to an 11th hour deal to replace NAFTA. The Dow rose 193 points, a gain of 0.7%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%. The reworked trade deal, announced late Sunday night, was reached after Canada agreed to give US dairy farmers greater access to the Canadian market. The United States also agreed to make concessions on some automobile tariffs for cars and trucks built in Canada and Mexico as part of the agreement, which replaces NAFTA and will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Shares in major automakers rose on the news. GM gained 1.6%, and Ford climbed 0.8%. Fiat Chrysler rose 2.7%. Still, some market experts said investors may be overreacting to the USMCA deal. That’s because the United States still faces another major trade battle. “While the U.S. has reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, growing trade conflict between China and the U.S. threatens economic growth in both countries,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds, in a report Monday. Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB, also thinks that China-US tension will not be resolved this easily. “The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada. And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with China—the Chinese have leverage over the US that Canada simply doesn’t have,” Winograd wrote, referring to China’s ownership of US Treasury debt as well as the fact that it’s a much bigger market for US exports. “I certainly wouldn’t rule out an agreement being reached with China, but I don’t think that the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement provides a template that can be used in discussions with the Chinese,” Winograd added. Others think that a US-China deal is inevitable, which makes the market’s reaction to the USMCA agreement, a logical one. “The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada. And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with China.” Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB “Many investors are betting there’s room for a market friendly compromise after the US midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25% tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019,” wrote Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a report. Other market movers It’s not just the trade deal helping move the markets. The surprise ouster of General Electric CEO John Flannery and a deal between Tesla and the SEC are also having a big effect. Shares of GE jumped 7% following the news that Flannery, who had only been CEO since August 2017, is being replaced by Larry Culp, a former head of industrial conglomerate Danaher. Culp, who joined GE’s board in April, faces a difficult task in getting GE back on track. GE also announced Monday that it was taking a charge tied to its struggling GE Power unit. The stock had fallen 35% so far this year prior to Monday’s surge. GE’s market value slipped below $100 billion last week for the first time in more than nine years. And the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in June after a more than 100-year stay in the iconic market barometer. Tesla also rallied Monday after the electric car maker reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will require Elon Musk to step down as chairman but allow him to stay on as CEO. Shares of Tesla climbed 17%. The stock plunged 14% Friday on the news that the SEC had filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of making “false and misleading statements” earlier this summer when he tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a deal to take Tesla private. As part of Tesla’s deal with the SEC, Musk did not admit to any wrongdoing. The company is also paying a $20 million fine.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180816135026-gfx-market-surge.jpg?q=x_0,y_200,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/news/companies/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-ceo/index.html?section=money_markets|Goldman Sachs’ new CEO has a lot of work to do|New York CNN Business — It’s a new era at Goldman Sachs. David Solomon, the part-time electronic dance DJ who previously served as president of the company and co-head of its investment banking division, took the reins from Lloyd Blankfein on Monday as CEO. Blankfein, who had served as CEO since 2006 and will stay on as chairman through the end of the year, is already thinking about his next chapter, which could include more “unrestrained tweeting.” He started weighing in on issues including climate change and immigration toward the end of his tenure. “I might venture forward on opinions that are my own opinions, without any regard for whether they serve the constituencies and the interests of Goldman Sachs,” Blankfein said in a sit-down with Solomon posted Monday to social media. His successor has plenty to do. The bank’s stock is down more than 11% this year. It has underperformed peers, weighed down by an inconsistent trading division that doesn’t mint money the way it used to. Recruitment and retention of top talent remains vital, as does the development of newer lines of business, such as Marcus, Goldman’s nascent retail banking venture. Here’s what tops Solomon’s to-do list. Trading division troubles Solomon’s first order of business is to turn around Goldman’s trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. “The trading business is really what has hurt them in the past couple of years,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. The unit made up more than half the bank’s revenue in 2012, but shrank to just over a third last year, as a calm market and low interest rates pushed investors toward lower-fee index funds and passive funds. Goldman’s trading side showed resilience last quarter, but not because of stocks. Revenue from bond, currency and commodities trading surged 45% from a year ago, while revenue from equities stayed stagnant. Solomon is willing to make changes. Last month, he installed Marty Chavez, the outgoing CFO, as co-lead of the struggling division. At a conference hosted by Sanford C. Bernstein in May, Solomon said that Goldman wasn’t sitting around “waiting for the environment to change,” and that the firm will keep investing in technology for trading. Diversity and talent Solomon is making his presence felt with other leadership changes. Stephen Scherr, who had been in charge of the consumer bank, is stepping into the CFO role. John Waldron, a longtime deputy of Solomon’s, will take over as president and chief operating officer. “The question is: How does his new team jell together?” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. Another challenge for Solomon will be attracting and keeping talent at the firm. Many young professionals have favored Silicon Valley over Wall Street in recent years, as tech companies entice college graduates with competitive pay and relaxed work environments. Goldman has loosened up, with results to show for it. Roughly two-thirds of employees are Millennials, while more than 25% are engineers. Still, the company must ramp up diversity efforts that started under Blankfein, Lip said. Solomon has signaled this is a priority. This summer, more women were added to the 33-person management committee. Goldman also said it had formed a committee to promote the careers of diverse business leaders at the company. Changing course As trading becomes a less reliable source of income, and many competitors scale up, Solomon’s Goldman is expected to explore new ways to grow its business. “The supermarket finance business model is what’s working well today, and Goldman is a lot [narrower],” Biggar said. Some of this work is underway. Last year, Goldman released a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion by 2020, in part by bulking up other parts of the company. And the firm has doubled down on its consumer arm, Marcus. Goldman, which launched Marcus in the United States in 2016, started to offer savings accounts in the UK last week. The bank may expand into life insurance, mortgages, auto loans and wealth management services down the road. “We have the ambition to build a large, differentiated, highly profitable digital consumer finance platform,” Solomon said in May. Solomon has been at the bank since 1999. He’s expected to be a leader in Blankfein’s mold, though his extracurricular interests certainly set him apart. “This is not somebody they’re bringing in from the outside that will radically alter the makeup of the company,” Biggar said. “I don’t think anyone’s expecting that. But there are things on the edges he could do.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180928131309-01-david-solomon-file-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/30/news/california-requires-women-board-of-directors/index.html?section=money_markets|California has a new law: No more all-male boards|New York CNN Business — Companies headquartered in California can no longer have all-male boards. That’s according to a new law, enacted Sunday, which requires publicly traded firms in the state to place at least one woman on their board of directors by the end of 2019 — or face a penalty. It also requires companies with five directors to add two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six or more directors to add at least three more women by the end of the same year. It’s the first such law on the books in the United States, though similar measures are common in European countries. The measure was passed by California’s state legislature last month. And it was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday, along with a trove of other bills that look to “protect and support women, children and working families,” the governor’s office said in a release. A majority of companies in the S&P 500 have at least one woman on their boards, but only about a quarter have more than two, according to a study from PwC. California state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson told The Wall Street Journal last month when the legislation passed that “one-fourth of California’s publicly traded companies still do not have a single woman on their board, despite numerous independent studies that show companies with women on their board are more profitable and productive.” “With women comprising over half the population and making over 70% of purchasing decisions, their insight is critical to discussions and decisions that affect corporate culture, actions and profitability,” she told the outlet. Some see California’s law as a crucial step toward establishing better parity in corporate leadership. But setting quotas can be controversial, Vicki W. Kramer, lead author of the landmark 2006 study, “Critical Mass on Corporate Boards,” told CNN last month. Opponents argue that pressure from quotas will lead to unqualified female members and potential discrimination against male candidates. When quotas are not set, however, companies may fail to diversify their ranks. She points to more “aspirational” legislation in other states, like in Pennsylvania, where a 2017 resolution urged both public and private companies to have a minimum of 30% women on their boards by 2020. But without teeth in the law, Kramer said, better numbers won’t follow. Kramer said California’s legislation is weak compared to the laws in Norway and other European countries, which require a certain percentage of women on boards. For larger Norwegian companies, the legislation requires that women make up as much as 40% of the board.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180928142605-women-board-representation-2-gfx.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/instagram-adam-mosseri/index.html?section=money_markets|Instagram gets a new chief: Facebook vet Adam Mosseri|New York CNN Business — Instagram has a new leader. On Monday, the company announced that Adam Mosseri will head Instagram effective immediately. Last week, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they would leave the company. “We are thrilled to hand over the reins to a product leader with a strong design background and a focus on craft and simplicity — as well as a deep understanding of the importance of community,” Systrom and Krieger said in a statement. Mosseri – who joined Facebook, which owns Instagram, in 2008 – has held various roles at the company, including head of News Feed and design director for Facebook’s mobile apps. Most recently, he was Instagram’s VP of product. In his new role, Mosseri will oversee “all functions of the business” and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations. Mike Krieger, Adam Mosseri and Kevin Systrom. Instagram Before their departures, Systrom was CEO and Krieger was the chief technology officer. The duo founded the photo-sharing app in a co-working space in 2010. It became a big hit, attracting tens of millions of users before the co-founders sold it to Facebook (FB) in 2012 for $1 billion. With Facebook’s backing, Instagram continued to grow and added new features like videos, disappearing posts and, most recently, a hub for long-form content called IGTV. According to Instagram, the app now has over 1 billion monthly active users. While it’s not uncommon for founders to leave after their company is acquired, it’s notable that Systrom and Krieger stayed on for six years after Facebook acquired their company. It’s unclear what the two will do next. In a statement last week, Systrom said: “We’re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again … Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that’s what we plan to do.” Systrom and Krieger’s exodus come less than six months after Jan Koum stepped down as CEO of messaging platform WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased in 2014 for $19 billion. Brian Acton, the other WhatsApp founder, left Facebook in 2017. He backed calls earlier this year for people to delete Facebook amid revelations that Cambridge Analytica accessed millions of users’ data without their knowledge.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001141319-adam-mosseri.jpg?q=x_0,y_174,h_2100,w_3733,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/investing/ryanair-profit-warning/index.html?section=money_markets|Ryanair’s strikes are hitting its profits and stock price|London CNN Business — Ryanair could be headed for a rough landing this year. Europe’s leading low cost airline slashed its profit forecast for the current fiscal year to between €1.1 billion ($1.27 billion) and €1.2 billion ($1.39 billion). That’s about €150 million ($174 million) less than the company had expected. Ryanair (RYAAY) said that strikes and flight cancellations in September had resulted in lower traffic and higher costs. It warned that customer fears of further cancellations had led to reduced bookings, forcing the airline to cut fares in the third quarter. Shares in Ryanair dropped over 10% in London, leaving the stock down more than 22% so far this year. The company said it could slash its profit guidance further if the strikes continue. A sharp rise in fuel costs has also heaped pressure on the airline and its outspoken CEO Michael O’Leary, who is confronting labor unions after staff strikes forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months. Ryanair first recognized unions in December 2017 and has since struck labor agreements with pilots in Ireland and Italy. It has yet to reach agreements with union officials in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Germany and Belgium. A turning point for low-cost airlines? Over the long run, labor disputes, shrinking profit margins and rising customer dissatisfaction could undermine the business model that made Ryanair the largest airline in Europe, with 13,000 employees and a fleet of 430 aircraft. Rival budget carrier EasyJet (ESYJY) said Friday it was gaining business because of Ryanair’s troubles. But it too gave a cautious outlook about its earnings because of increased fuel costs and pay deals for staff. Ryanair cabin crew members protest in Madrid. VICTOR LERENA/EPA-EFE Analysts at Bernstein said Ryanair’s profit warning is “the latest indication that the ‘low cost wins, legacy loses’ story may be coming to an end.” The analysts said that earnings at traditional carriers — such as Lufthansa (DLAKY) and British Airways — would be less affected by rising fuel costs, making them more attractive to investors. The tougher climate is now forcing Ryanair to scale back. The company said Monday that it would close bases at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, and Bremen and Niederrhein in Germany on November 5. It said that affected pilots would likely be offered other positions and it would seek to minimize job losses among cabin crew.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001085619-ryanair-michael-oleary-0926.jpg?q=x_3,y_153,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/technology/california-net-neutrality-suit/index.html?section=money_technology|The internet industry is suing California over its net neutrality law|The internet industry is suing the state of California over its days-old net neutrality law. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by major trade groups representing broadband companies, is the second major lawsuit filed against the state over the law — the first was brought by the Justice Department. On Sunday evening, California Governor Jerry Brown signed what is considered to be the strictest net neutrality law in the country. Under the law, internet service providers will not be allowed to block or slow specific types of content or applications, or charge apps or companies fees for faster access to customers. Hours later, the federal government filed a lawsuit in which it alleged that California was "attempting to subvert the Federal Government's deregulatory approach" to the internet. The DOJ argues states can't pass their own laws governing internet companies, because broadband services cross state lines. It is fighting the state over a clause in the 2017 order repealing Obama-era federal net neutrality protections. In that order, the FCC said it could pre-empt state-level net neutrality laws. The impending legal battle could drag on for many months if not longer, Daniel Lyons, an associate professor at Boston College Law School who specializes in telecommunications and Internet regulation, told CNN. A lot is riding on the outcome. The California law is considered the most thorough state-level net neutrality legislation yet passed, and other states are expected to use it as a blueprint for their own laws. If California wins in court, it would open the door for those other states to take similar actions. However, the FCC could try to come back with an order to block their efforts again, Lyons said. California will likely claim that the pre-emption provision is invalid, Lyons said, while the federal government will attempt to get an injunction to stop the law from taking effect. in doing so, it will claim that the law will cause harm if allowed to take effect. "These attempts at getting a preliminary injunction seem weak and are likely to fail for the same reasons that the Internet Service Provider [ISP] industry was unable to obtain a stay of the FCC's former net neutrality rules in 2015," said telecommunications attorney Pantelis Michalopoulos, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP who has argued net neutrality cases. "The Internet Service Providers offer speculative theories about why they will suffer irreparable injury. These theories do not appear to satisfy the test for a preliminary injunction." The industry groups taking part in the new lawsuit represent major companies including AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, as well as other cable companies and wireless providers across the US. The groups had previously lobbied against the state law. (CNN is owned by AT&T.) "We oppose California's action to regulate internet access because it threatens to negatively affect services for millions of consumers and harm new investment and economic growth. Republican and Democratic administrations, time and again, have embraced the notion that actions like this are preempted by federal law," the trade groups USTelecom, CTIA -- The Wireless Association, The Internet & Television Association, and the American Cable Association said in a statement. "We will continue our work to ensure Congress adopts bipartisan legislation to create a permanent framework for protecting the open internet that consumers expect and deserve." In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Attorney General Xavier Becerra indicated the state would fight to protect its new law. "This suit was brought by power brokers who have an obvious financial interest in maintaining their stronghold on the public's access to online content. California, the country's economic engine, has the right to exercise its sovereign powers under the Constitution and we will do everything we can to protect the right of our 40 million consumers to access information by defending a free and open Internet," Becerra said in a statement. State Senator Scott Wiener, a co-author of the bill, previously told CNN he expected the ISPs to sue over the law. "The internet service providers have every right to sue California, just like California has every right—indeed an obligation—to protect our residents' access to an open internet," Wiener said after the trade groups filed their suit.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/181003145709-net-neutrality-protest-2017-file-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/03/technology/bumble-india-priyanka-chopra/index.html?section=money_technology|Bumble to expand to India with the help of actress Priyanka Chopra|New York CNN Business — Bumble is the latest online dating app to compete for the hearts of women in India. Bumble, which requires women to make the first move, announced Wednesday plans to launch in India later this year. Indian celebrity Priyanka Chopra, a new investor in the company, will advise on the expansion. The news comes less than a week after rival Tinder launched a My Move feature in India that gives women the option to prevent men from initiating a conversation. But Bumble’s efforts for an expansion in India have been in the works for awhile. Founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said the newly engaged Chopra first told her “Indian women needed Bumble” months ago. Chopra was among a group of high-profile women who helped Bumble kickoff its networking app, Bumble Bizz, in October 2017. “It was clear then we shared a passion for empowering young women on a global level,” Wolfe Herd told CNN in an e-mail. “From there we began architecting a plan to partner and launch Bumble in India.” Wolfe Herd said the challenge in entering the Indian market is “localizing the experience and attracting women” — an area in which Chopra will help. Chopra’s manager, Anjula Acharia, is also an investor and adviser. Acharia helped Chopra — who was already established in India — reach fame in the United States. But Acharia has a long history of crossover efforts. She was instrumental in introducing artists such as Britney Spears and Lady Gaga to India — a background that could translate to Acharia helping Bumble resonate with the local audience. Bumble’s local app will be in both Hindi and Hinglish — a hybrid between Hindi and English — and available on iOS and Android. It will also roll out new safety features before entering the region, which has a reputation for violence against women. In June, India was named the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman. Wolfe Herd said it will only require Indian women to provide the first initial of their name — no first or last names — and provide new ways to report “bad behavior” in the app. Bumble already has photo verification features and more than 4,000 content moderators who review photos and profiles. Before Bumble, Wolfe Herd was an early employee and exec at Tinder but left the company in 2014 after suing for sexual harassment and discrimination. The case was eventually settled. But tension between the two dating companies has become increasingly palpable as a result of very public litigation between the Bumble and Match Group, Tinder’s parent company. In March, Match Group targeted Bumble with a lawsuit accusing the company of patent infringement and stealing trade secrets. Bumble asked the court last week to dismiss the case. Separately, Bumble filed a counter lawsuit against Match Group. Bumble argues that Match Group is using litigation as revenge over failed acquisition talks. Both lawsuits are ongoing. While Bumble already operates in over 160 countries, India is a significant market because of its size. According to a report from Bain & Co, India has 390 million internet users, the second largest of any country behind China.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002113305-100218-priyanka-chopra-bumble-gfx.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3999,c_fill/w_800

Under the settlement, which requires court approval, Musk will be allowed to stay as CEO but must leave his role as chairman of the board within 45 days. He cannot seek reelection for three years, according to court filings. He accepted the deal with the SEC "without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint," according to a court document. Separately, Tesla agreed Saturday to pay $20 million to settle claims it failed to adequately police Musk's tweet. "The $40 million in penalties will be distributed to harmed investors under a court-approved process," the SEC said in a press release. The company also agreed to appoint two new independent directors to its board and establish a board committee to oversee Musk's communications. Tesla declined to comment. A spokesperson confirmed Musk will be permitted to remain a member of the board. The announcement from the SEC comes two days after the agency filed a lawsuit against Musk, claiming he misled investors. The suit centers on tweets Musk sent on August 7 in which he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, causing the company's stock to soar. He had not secured the funding, the SEC said. The lawsuit sought to ban Musk from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company. Musk called the SEC's suit "unjustified." "I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors," he said. "Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way." CNBC, citing unnamed sources, reported that the agency filed the suit on Thursday after Musk refused an earlier settlement offer. Under that deal, Musk would have had to pay a "nominal fine" and leave his role as chairman for two years. He chose not to accept the terms because "because he felt that by settling he would not be truthful to himself," according to the outlet. A representative for Musk did not immediately reply to CNN's request for comment Saturday. Jay Dubow, a partner at Pepper Hamilton and a veteran of the SEC's enforcement division, said it was "unusual" that the SEC agreed to let Musk stay on as chief executive but exit the chairman role. It's surprising considering "the conduct at issue, if [the SEC] really thought it was egregious," Dubow said. "The CEO is certainly more involved than the chairman in day-to-day operations." He suggested the SEC may have determined that removing Musk as CEO would cause more harm to Tesla's share price, and thus harm investors. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson estimated in a recent note that Tesla's stock has a $130 "Musk premium," which could disappear if he leaves. Still unclear is whether or not the Department of Justice will file criminal charges against Musk. Tesla confirmed earlier this month that the DOJ was investigating whether Musk's comments about taking his company private constituted criminal activity. Dubow, the former SEC official, said he suspects nothing will come of it. "My guess is that it's still possible the DOJ will pursue something, but...it's more likely than not that the DOJ chooses not to pursue this," he said. The settlement has likely assuaged the SEC, mitigating the DOJ's incentive to act.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927184652-elon-musk-neutral-expression-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/alexis-ohanian-initialized-capital/index.html?section=money_technology|Alexis Ohanian’s VC firm raises new $225M fund|New York CNN Business — Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian’s venture capital firm has raised an additional $225 million to invest in early-stage startups. It is the fourth and largest fund raised by Initialized Capital, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm founded by Ohanian and Garry Tan. The new fund, announced on Tuesday, comes as Ohanian spends more time with the firm. About nine months ago, he stepped away from his day-to-day role at Reddit, the popular discussion board platform he co-founded in 2005. When Initialized Capital launched in 2012, Ohanian and Tan were also partners at Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator fund known for helping companies like Airbnb and Dropbox get off the ground. Tan and Ohanian credit their past experiences as engineers, operators and investors at Y Combinator for their success as investors at their own firm. Garry Tan (left) and Alexis Ohanian Jessica Monroy “We know that investors sitting around a table are not going to be able to come up with the future because we aren’t the ones actively building it, but we’ve seen enough and built enough in the way of software and scalable businesses that our ‘Spidey’ senses start tingling when we get on the right track with a founder,” Ohanian told CNN Tuesday. Together, Ohanian and Tan have invested in several startups that are now “unicorns” -— the term for privately-held startups valued at $1 billion or more. That includes crypto marketplace Coinbase and grocery delivery startup Instacart, among others. Initialized Capital will remained focused primarily on funding early-stage startups but will cut larger checks, such as $1 million, compared to $50,000, the size of some of its first investments. That’s a sign of the times — valuations and deal sizes have grown in recent years. The average deal size in the second quarter of this year was $18 million, the highest this decade, according to PitchBook. The firm now has a team of eight partners who help portfolio companies with everything from product development to legal, design and marketing. Ohanian and Tan say their approach to funding startups is “thesis agnostic,” but they tend to look for businesses with “software at their core.” They’ve invested in startups like Voyage — a self-driving car company that operates its vehicles in two retirement communities — as well Ro, a healthcare company whose first brand, Roman, is helping diagnose and treat those with erectile dysfunction. “We still feel like there’s a lot of work left to be done when it comes to software solving big problems,” said Ohanian, who also sits on the board of Reddit and Ro. “This is our sweet spot.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002160151-alexis-ohanian-and-garry-tan.jpg?q=x_3,y_163,h_1796,w_3193,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/technology/microsoft-surface-computers/index.html?section=money_technology|Microsoft unveils new Surface devices, smart headphones|New York CNN Business — Fall is the season for new gadgets. Apple recently announced its latest iPhones, Amazon showed off new smart speakers and even an Alexa-activated microwave, and Google is hosting its own product launch event next week. But Tuesday is all about Microsoft, which unveiled a slew of devices ahead of the holiday shopping season. Its lineup includes a new version of its desktop computer, called the Surface Studio 2, and its first pair of smart headphones. It also announced the Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. The first Surface desktop, an iMac competitor focused on creativity, was introduced in October 2016. Its successor, the Surface Studio 2, offers improved graphics performance and Microsoft says it’s the fastest Surface device ever made. It has a 28-inch display and USB-C support. It’s available for pre-order on Tuesday starting at $3,499. The Surface Headphones ($349) offer adjustable noise cancellation and automatic pause and play, which will stop the video you’re viewing when you take them off. Microsoft’s voice assistant Cortana is built in and can read your emails aloud or start a conference call. Surface Headphones will be available later this year. Microsoft's new Surface Studio 2 is all about creativity. Microsoft Meanwhile, Microsoft says the Surface Pro 6 is 67% faster than its predecessor but with the same battery life (up to 13.5 hours). Microsoft also says it’s easy to toggle between laptop, studio and tablet mode. It comes in black and platinum and starts at $899. The Surface Headphones are Microsoft's first premium and smart headphones. Microsoft The original Surface Pro in 2012 was marketed as a tablet. It looked kind of like an iPad, but with the addition of a keyboard cover. Microsoft (MSFT) has since shifted its pitch to a laptop with a touchscreen. This 2-in-1 format is aimed at people like doctors, pilots and students who need tablets for note-taking or reading, but a laptop for full functionality. The Surface Pro 6 is faster than its predecessor. Microsoft The Surface Laptop 2 (starting at $999) comes with faster and quieter typing and up to 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. It’s 85% faster than its predecessor, and the Surface Laptop 2 comes in a new color (black), as well as the existing options burgundy, platinum and blue. The Surface Laptop 2 has faster and quieter typing. Microsoft “More and more, devices are permeating your whole life. We build these things to appeal for your work and personal life,” Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s corporate VP of modern life and devices, told CNN. The company also unveiled its next-generation Windows software – called Windows 10 October 2018 Update – which has a focus on productivity. For example, the Your Phone App brings texts and photos from your Android phone to your PC. (Apple allows such an integration for its iMessage service.) You can also integrate a To-Do list with Outlook.com, and drag an item into an open slot on your calendar to block time to finish it. Microsoft’s main audience for these new devices is enterprise business professionals, according to Andrew Hewitt, an analyst at research firm Forrester. Ahead of Tuesday’s event, he noted Microsoft has heavily invested in productivity elements including Timeline, which lets you go back to where you left off on files and websites, and Focus Assistant, a feature that limits distractions like notifications. “There is a sense that Microsoft is trying to compete with Apple on the creative front, with new capabilities for picture and movie editing,” Hewitt said. “But the other features are much more aligned with Microsoft’s mission to empower employees to be productive.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181002131210-03-microsoft-surface-computers.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1500,w_2665,c_fill/w_800

Her hire comes nearly three months after the controversial exit of the previous HR chief. Nikki Krishnamurthy will replace Liane Hornsey, who left Uber in early July after an internal investigation into how she handled racial discrimination claims within the company, the company announced on Tuesday. Krishnamurthy comes from Expedia where she served as its chief people officer. She worked with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Before joining Uber last August, Khosrowshahi spent a decade leading Expedia. In a statement, Khosrowshahi called Krishnamurthy a “trusted partner” who will help “evolve our culture.” The move marks another key hire under Khosrowshahi, who has been tasked with cleaning up the company’s corporate culture. Uber has faced with a string of scandals, including widespread allegations of gender and sexual harassment that led to co-founder Travis Kalanick’s resignation as CEO in June 2017. Krishnamurthy, whose title is chief people officer, will oversee Uber’s human resources, recruiting, workplace, and diversity and inclusion teams.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/facebook-hack-tinder-pinterest/index.html?section=money_technology|Tinder, Pinterest and others struggle to determine how Facebook hack affects their users|New York CNN Business — A massive Facebook breach may also have affected users of hundreds of other websites and apps. But three days after the public disclosure of the breach, it’s not clear that those companies know what, if anything, might have happened to their users. A spokesperson for the dating app Tinder said Monday that Facebook has shared only “limited information” and called on Facebook to be “transparent” about which of Tinder’s users may have been affected. In a statement Monday, Facebook said it was preparing more guidance for app developers. A wide range of digital services, including big names like Tinder, Spotify and Airbnb, allow users to log in to accounts on their platforms using their Facebook credentials, a process known as Single Sign-On, or SSO. The breach, which Facebook has said affected 50 million of its users, would have allowed hackers to log in as those people on Facebook and on apps and websites that allow SSO though Facebook. CNN reached out to almost a dozen companies that offer the Facebook login capability. None of them would say if they had identified any overlap between their users who log in using Facebook and the 50 million Facebook users whose data was exposed. Identifying that overlap could allow the companies to examine if affected Facebook users’ data was also compromised on their platforms. Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that single sign-on is a useful feature, but also a very risky one. “The importance here is that since Facebook has become the most popular identity provider out there it’s not easy to evaluate how many accounts of yours hackers might have accessed,” said Polakis, who has studied the feature extensively. In a statement to CNN on Monday, Tinder said it has done “a full forensic investigation” since Facebook’s “limited” disclosure and has found “no evidence to suggest accounts have been accessed.” Tinder continued, “We will continue to investigate and be vigilant — as we always are — and if Facebook would be transparent and share the affected user lists, it would be very helpful in our investigation.” A Tinder spokesperson pointed out that most of its new users sign up to the service without using a Facebook login. Pinterest, another company that allows its users to log in using Facebook, told CNN that it was working with Facebook to determine if any Pinterest users were impacted. Facebook said in a statement Monday that developers of apps that use Facebook login “can detect the forced logout actions we took on Friday and protect people using their apps.” “We are preparing additional recommendations for all developers responding to this incident and to protect people going forward,” a Facebook spokesperson added. Airbnb and GoFundMe, two major services that allow users to log in through Facebook, did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Spotify told CNN it takes the security of its users’ privacy very seriously. The company added that “as a precaution, concerned users can update their Spotify password, or if the account was created through Facebook, the Facebook login via their instructions.” The precautionary advisory comes after Facebook told users that they didn’t need to change their passwords because the hackers did not have access to passwords. No company that CNN reached out to explained what practical steps they were taking to ensure their users had not been affected by the attack on Facebook. Headspace, a meditation and wellness app, told CNN, “We’ve investigated the matter and found no abnormalities, though we have initiated precautionary measures to protect our members and are continuing to monitor.” The company did not detail what its investigation entailed nor what precautionary measures it took. Other apps allow their users to log in through Facebook but have additional security measures on top of that login. A spokesperson for Ancestry told CNN, “While Ancestry does support Facebook login for some functions, we always require an additional Ancestry username and password to access sensitive account functions such as downloading your DNA data, changing your password, changing your email address or accessing payment information. Our customers’ exposure is minimized by these additional controls.” TransferWise, a money wire service that allows users to log in through Facebook, said its investigation was underway but that it had “no indication” that its customers had been affected. The company said that in order for any money to be transferred users are asked to verify their identity through a second step that does not involve Facebook.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001153624-100118-facebook-hacking-gfx.jpg?q=x_0,y_371,h_2250,w_3999,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/technology/instagram-adam-mosseri/index.html?section=money_technology|Instagram gets a new chief: Facebook vet Adam Mosseri|New York CNN Business — Instagram has a new leader. On Monday, the company announced that Adam Mosseri will head Instagram effective immediately. Last week, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they would leave the company. “We are thrilled to hand over the reins to a product leader with a strong design background and a focus on craft and simplicity — as well as a deep understanding of the importance of community,” Systrom and Krieger said in a statement. Mosseri – who joined Facebook, which owns Instagram, in 2008 – has held various roles at the company, including head of News Feed and design director for Facebook’s mobile apps. Most recently, he was Instagram’s VP of product. In his new role, Mosseri will oversee “all functions of the business” and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations. Mike Krieger, Adam Mosseri and Kevin Systrom. Instagram Before their departures, Systrom was CEO and Krieger was the chief technology officer. The duo founded the photo-sharing app in a co-working space in 2010. It became a big hit, attracting tens of millions of users before the co-founders sold it to Facebook (FB) in 2012 for $1 billion. With Facebook’s backing, Instagram continued to grow and added new features like videos, disappearing posts and, most recently, a hub for long-form content called IGTV. According to Instagram, the app now has over 1 billion monthly active users. While it’s not uncommon for founders to leave after their company is acquired, it’s notable that Systrom and Krieger stayed on for six years after Facebook acquired their company. It’s unclear what the two will do next. In a statement last week, Systrom said: “We’re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again … Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that’s what we plan to do.” Systrom and Krieger’s exodus come less than six months after Jan Koum stepped down as CEO of messaging platform WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased in 2014 for $19 billion. Brian Acton, the other WhatsApp founder, left Facebook in 2017. He backed calls earlier this year for people to delete Facebook amid revelations that Cambridge Analytica accessed millions of users’ data without their knowledge.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181001141319-adam-mosseri.jpg?q=x_0,y_174,h_2100,w_3733,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/technology/tesla-production/index.html?section=money_technology|Can the Model 3 survive the controversy?|Can Tesla navigate through its many controversies and still meet its sales targets? We're about to find out. Early next week Tesla will report how many cars it made in the third quarter and how many it was actually able to deliver to customers. Three months ago, investors and Tesla fans waited to see if the company could hit its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3 cars in a week. It just made that goal, building 5,031 in the last week of June. Experts say the report on third quarter production is much more important to the company and its future. It'll show whether the production level at the end of the second quarter was a blip or sustainable. "The idea of having sustained production is so much more important than a production sprint during a week," said Jeremy Acevedo manager of industry analysis at Edmunds. "The difference between 5,000 a week and 20,000 a month is huge." And even more importantly it'll show whether Tesla (TSLA) is on track to meet CEO Elon Musk's promises that the company would be profitable in the third and fourth quarters. The company had only two marginally profitable quarters in its history as a public company, and posted its largest loss ever in the second quarter as it rushed to ramp up production. The losses, and more than $1 billion in debt that will be come due at Tesla by next spring, are why some experts are raising the possibility of a cash crunch at Tesla that could force it to sell more shares to raise cash. That could be more difficult as the stock loses value and Musk faces a federal lawsuit for misleading investors. Musk has insisted that the company will not need to raise cash because it will generate more revenue with increased production. But he also has admitted that the company is having trouble delivering all the cars it is building. "Sorry, we've gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell," Musk tweeted two weeks ago, though he promised, "We're making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly." Sorry, we've gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We're making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2018 Needless to say, its customers who are waiting for their Teslas aren't paying for their long-anticipated cars until they actually get delivered. So the logistics problems could be its own red flag for the company revenue. "The delivery scramble and chaos they're going through right now, it's disconcerting," said Rebecca Lindland, analyst with Cox Automotive. She said that while some fans of Tesla might want to focus on whatever production number is reported, it's important to look at both production and deliveries. Tesla's most consequential report in its history has been overshadowed with controversy. In August Musk announced via tweet that he was planning to take the company private at a price of $420 a share, and that he had "funding secured" to do so. Although he had some investors expressing interest in financing such a deal, there was nothing secured, according to the SEC. He dropped plans to go private by the end of the month. But by then he had already been sued by shareholders who charged that the tweet was a deceptive effort to manipulate the stock price. And Thursday the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against Musk, seeking to have him removed as an officer at Tesla or any other public company. Add in stories about Musk not getting any sleep and smoking pot during a podcast, and his other company SpaceX selling a trip to the moon for a billionaire tourist on his other company SpaceX, and its easy to forget that a good measure of success is actually how many cars you can build and sell.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927140623-01-tesla-car-sales-780x439.jpg

"If you buy or own Tesla stock, be prepared for a wild ride," Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs told CNNMoney. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Elon Musk on Thursday for making "false and misleading" statements to investors in an August 7 tweet that said he had secured funding to take Tesla (TSLA) private at $420 a share. The SEC alleges he did not have the funding secured. Tesla's stock fell 12% to $270 a share on Friday. The company's future is in the "board's court now and it remains to be seen what will happen next," wrote Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne in a note. The firm slashed Tesla's price target to $200 per share. Tesla needs to raise $2 billion in the fourth quarter to avoid bankruptcy in 2019, Osbourne estimates. That will be more of a challenge with Musk's future in doubt, Osbourne said. The firm chided Tesla as a company "that has always over promised and under delivered." Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said that Tesla's stock has a $130 "Musk premium," which could disappear if he leaves. If a judge forces Musk to step aside, investors will "focus back on the value of Tesla as a niche automaker, rather than a founder-led likely disrupter of multiple industries," Johnson wrote in a note aptly titled "Lawsuit Secured" to clients.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-breach-50-million/index.html?section=money_technology|Facebook hack exposed 50 million users' info -- and accounts on other sites|An attack on Facebook exposed information on nearly 50 million of the social network's users, the company announced Friday -- and gave the attackers access to those users' accounts with other sites and apps that they logged into using Facebook. The attackers exploited a bug in a feature called "View as" that lets users see their Facebook page the way someone else would. The attackers were able to take over the accounts and use them exactly as if they were the account holders. That would include posting or viewing information shared by any of that account's friends. Facebook says no credit card information stored with the company was accessed. Facebook (FB) said it does not know who the attackers were or where they were based. It also said it has already fixed the issue and informed the FBI and other law enforcement, as well as lawmakers and regulators. It has also informed the Irish Data Protection Commission about the breach, a step required by Europe's GDPR regulations. The commission said it received the notification, but expressed concern with its timing and lack of detail. More than 90 million users were forcibly logged out of their accounts by Facebook and had to log back in on Friday for security reasons. The accounts of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg were among the 90 million accounts forcibly logged out by Facebook. Users do not need to take any additional security precautions or reset their passwords, said Facebook. All logged out users will receive a notification about the issue from Facebook, but it won't tell them if they were in the group of 50 million impacted or 40 million included as a precaution. The attackers would have also been able to access third-party services or sites accessed with a Facebook login, Facebook's Guy Rosen said in a follow-up call with reporters on Friday, though it is not yet clear if they did so. It could have also impacted Instagram accounts that use the same login as Facebook, but Rosen said WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, was not impacted. It's the largest hack ever for Facebook, a spokesperson said. The company says it does not know if the affected accounts were misused in any way or if any user information was actually accessed. It has not determined if any specific locations or accounts were targeted. It has turned off the "View As" feature that the attackers exploited while it investigates. "From experience, breach notifications like this always tend to get worse as time goes on and information from investigations is shared with the public," said Jessy Irwin, the head of security at cybersecurity firm Tendermint. "There's not much that is public about how those [linked] accounts are impacted, but this seems to go much deeper into Facebook's entire ecosystem than Cambridge Analytica did." Facebook says the vulnerability is the result of three distinct bugs, and originally appeared in July 2017 when the company made a change to a video uploading feature. The company first detected some unusual activity -- a spike in user access to the site -- on September 16, 2018. It launched an investigation and uncovered this attack on Tuesday, September 25. On Wednesday it notified law enforcement and on Thursday evening it fixed the vulnerability and began resetting login tokens, according to Facebook. The attackers stole Facebook "access tokens" which keep a person logged into their Facebook account over long periods of time so they don't have to keep signing in. Facebook reset all 50 million tokens, as well as tokens for an additional 40 million people who had used the "View as" feature in the past year as a "precautionary step." The reset also unlinked accounts like Instagram and Oculus, both of which are owned by Facebook, which users will need to relink. "The reality here is we face constant attacks from people who want to take over accounts or steal information.... we need to do more to prevent this from happening in the first place," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a call with reporters shortly after the announcement. The announcement is the latest issue for the company, which has struggled with security breaches, privacy issues and misinformation in recent years. Facebook says it is investing heavily in security going forward, and increasing the number of people working on security from 10,000 to 20,000. "Security is an arms race and we're continuing to improve our defenses," said Zuckerberg. -- CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, Laurie Segall and Sara O'Brien contributed reporting.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180321163948-mz-cnn-zuckerberg-facebook-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/technology/blackberry-earnings-john-chen/index.html?section=money_technology|BlackBerry's comeback continues|BlackBerry's transformation from struggling smartphone company into a burgeoning leader in cybersecurity software and connected cars is on track. The company now generates more than 90% of its total revenue from software and services. And 81% of those sales are recurring. In other words, BlackBerry is no longer subject to the fickle tastes of consumers and has hitched its wagon to corporate customers. BlackBerry (BB) reported profits and sales Friday morning for its latest quarter that topped Wall Street's forecasts. The stock was up more than 15% in late morning trading on the news. CEO John Chen, speaking to CNN Friday, said the company's biggest successes this quarter were in the connected and autonomous car market, with revenue growth of about 30% for the business unit that includes the QNX software business for cars. Chen said BlackBerry is working hard to win more customers in the automotive market, pointing to a deal it announced in January with Chinese search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) to jointly develop self-driving cars. The company, under Chen, realized a few years ago that it was a losing battle making devices that generated razor-thin profit margins at a time when Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) dominate the smartphone race. That's why BlackBerry decided in 2016 to stop making its own phones and outsource the production of devices with the BlackBerry name on them to other manufacturers. Since then, BlackBerry has gone all-in on software. BlackBerry hoping for a new 'Spark' So what's next? Chen said he's hopeful that BlackBerry's new Spark security platform, which is kind of like instant messaging on steroids, can make a bigger presence in the health care market. Spark integrates video chat, texts and other forms of media. BlackBerry is targeting health to help the company expand beyond its core markets of transportation, governments and financial services companies. Investors are pleased with the turnaround too. BlackBerry's stock is up more than 60% since Chen took over nearly five years ago. That's solid, but it has lagged the performance of Apple as well as the Nasdaq. Still, Chen has cleaned up BlackBerry's balance sheet. The company now has $2.4 billion in cash and just $740 million in long-term debt. Rumors about BlackBerry going out of business are no longer running rampant the way they were before Chen joined. BlackBerry's board is happy with Chen's leadership as well. BlackBerry announced in March that it was extending Chen's contract through November 2023. That may also put to rest some of the rumors that Chen was only going to stick around long enough to sell BlackBerry to a larger rival.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180928091528-01-john-chen-blackberry-file-restricted-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-rocket/index.html?section=money_technology|Jeff Bezos's rocket company beats out spaceflight veteran for engine contract|Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket company just scored a major contract. His company's BE-4 engines will power United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur, a new suite of rockets that will aim to better compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX on price. Its first launch is slated for 2020. The contract award with ULA marks a high-profile vote of confidence for Bezos's space startup. "We are very glad to have our BE-4 engine selected by United Launch Alliance. United Launch Alliance is the premier launch service provider for national security missions, and we're thrilled to be part of their team and that mission," Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith said in a statement announcing the award on Thursday. ULA, a venture co-owned by longtime government contractors Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), competes with SpaceX to launch sensitive national security satellites for the US government. But the company had to rely on Russian made RD-180 engines to get its workhorse Atlas V rocket into orbit. That's caused some political headaches for ULA. Bezos, who has said he's funding Blue Origin in part by selling about $1 billion worth of his own stake in Amazon (AMZN) each year, had competition for the contract: aerospace company Aeroject Rocketdyne (AJRD), which has a storied history of providing propulsion technology for NASA as well as existing ULA rockets, also competed for the ULA engine contract. "ULA has chosen the best systems available to create the Vulcan Centaur," ULA CEO Tory Bruno said in a statement Thursday. Blue's big win Blue Origin's win does not come as a huge surprise. The BE-4 is further along in development than the comparable Aerojet engine, dubbed the AR1, and is expected to be less expensive to make. Bruno previously expressed his preference for Blue's BE-4 over Aerojet's AR1. The announcement "is pretty significant nonetheless," said Bill Ostrove, space analyst with Forecast International. "The fact that [Blue Origin] was able to defeat this established, storied company like Aerojet...it's a major victory for a startup." Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. The company has only launched test flights of its suborbital New Shepard rocket, which the company plans to use to fly tourists on short, scenic trips. It began developing the BE-4, a massive rocket engine intended for much more powerful launch vehicles, in 2011. The BE-4 completed its first test fire last year. Blue Origin's contract win means the company will move forward with plans to open a massive manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama. The firm said in July last year that it would build a 200,000 square foot plant that will employ up to 400 new manufacturing jobs if it cinched the ULA deal. It also puts Blue Origin in the enviable position of producing BE-4 engines for two different rockets that will ultimately compete against each other for launch contracts. In addition to supplying ULA's Vulcan, the BE-4 will power a Blue Origin's own heavy-lift rocket, called New Glenn. Those two rockets will also compete against companies like SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (NOC) to land lucrative military launch contracts. 'Major defeat' Blue Origin's victory marks a "major defeat" for Aerojet because it essentially leaves the company out of the market for developing main engines for any of those heavy-lift launch vehicles, Ostrove said. SpaceX makes engines in-house for its Falcon rockets, and Northrop Grumman is expected to do the same for its OmegA rocket. Nonetheless, Aerojet still has a solid book of business building smaller engines, including one that will power the Vulcan's upper stage. It also produces engines for NASA's Space Launch System. Steve Warren, Aerojet's vice president of communications, told CNN Thursday that Aerojet's AR1 can still be used to power medium-lift launch vehicles. "This could easily become the workhorse engine for America," he said. Ostrove is skeptical. "It's hard to see a place for it in the market," he said. "There's not much activity going on in that medium-class launch market."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171019170130-blue-origin-be-4-bezos-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/tesla-stock-musk-sec/index.html?section=money_technology|Tesla's stock tumbles after SEC sues Elon Musk|Tesla's stock tumbled Friday morning after the SEC sued Elon Musk for misleading investors. Musk tweeted on August 7 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Typically, stocks match takeover prices that a company publicizes. Investors assume the deal will be completed and the company will eventually be worth the price at which the company says it will be sold. However, skeptical investors never believed Musk, and the stock never approached anything close to $420 a share. It rose as high as $387.46 on August 7 and tumbled since then. Their skepticism was for good reason: Musk had never secured the funding, the SEC alleges. He abandoned the plan to go private three weeks after he first tweeted about it. The stock fell as low as $265 after the bell Thursday, 14% below Tesla's closing price for the day. Including the off-hours plunge, Tesla's stock has plummeted more than 29% since Musk's infamous tweet. Tesla's (TSLA) falling stock price could come back to haunt the company. Tesla is burning through cash to build expensive plants and cars, but it badly needs that money to pay about $1 billion in debt by February 2019. Most of that would convert to stock if Tesla's price holds above $360 — but that seems unlikely. If Tesla needs to pay back its debt with cash — and if the company lacks the cash to pay it — Tesla could raise the money by issuing more debt or stock. But that could further deflate its stock price, depressing the amount of capital the company has to spend on new infrastructure to build cars. Musk has denied that the company faces a cash crunch. He says increased Model 3 sales will generate enough cash to finally make Tesla profitable in the second half of 2018. The SEC's lawsuit could cause other problems for Tesla. The agency has asked a federal judge to prevent Musk from serving as an officer or a director of a public company, among other penalties. That's a serious concern for Tesla, which Musk built from scratch into a multibillion-dollar company. He's the carmaker's chairman and CEO.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927170152-tesla-stock-780x439.png
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/elon-musk-sec/index.html?section=money_technology|SEC sues Elon Musk for his allegedly misleading tweets|Elon Musk has tweeted himself into serious trouble. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tesla's CEO on Thursday for making "false and misleading" statements to investors. It's asking a federal judge to prevent Musk from serving as an officer or a director of a public company, among other penalties. The complaint hinges on a tweet Musk sent on August 7 about taking Tesla private. "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420," Musk said. "Funding secured." The SEC said he had not actually secured the funding. "In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source," the SEC said in its complaint. That tweet, and subsequent tweets from Musk over the next three hours, caused "significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla's stock," as well as harm to investors, the SEC said. On the day of Musk's tweet, Tesla's stock shot up nearly 9%. It has declined substantially since then. Tesla's (TSLA) stock dropped more than 11% in after-hours trading Thursday. "This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed," Musk said in a statement. "I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way." Tesla and its board of directors said in a joint statement that they are "are fully confident in Elon, his integrity, and his leadership of the company." "Our focus remains on the continued ramp of Model 3 production and delivering for our customers, shareholders and employees," the statement said. Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said at a press conference Thursday that the agency is committed to holding people accountable despite "celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator." The complaint alleged that Musk rounded up the go-private price to $420 per share "because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture" and thought his girlfriend would find it funny. He was dating the musician Grimes. Musk did not consult with any board members, employees or outside advisers before he sent the tweets, according to the SEC. "This is serious. This is what you go after insider traders and market manipulators on," said Charles Whitehead, professor at Cornell Law School. "This is a serious allegation." Musk abandoned the plan to take Tesla private less than three weeks after he first tweeted about it. He later said his "funding secured" comment was based on talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, which he said had urged him to take the company private and offered to increase its investment in Tesla. Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018 The Justice Department is also investigating comments made by Musk, Tesla said last week. The company said it had received a voluntary request for documents and is cooperating. Tesla said it had not been subpoenaed. Shareholders have also filed lawsuits charging that Musk made the claim to manipulate the stock price. Musk has brought a string of bad headlines down on himself with erratic behavior. He has fired off tweets late at night and brushed off analysts on corporate earnings calls. He disparaged a man who was working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand, and sparred with journalists and investors he believed were unfair to him. Musk vowed to launch a website called Pravda to critique the media. -- CNNMoney's Matt Egan and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180814155901-elon-musk-side-chicago-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/19/technology/iphone-xs-and-max-review/index.html?section=money_technology|iPhone XS and XS Max review: Apple’s latest are the best yet. But do you need them?|Editor’s Note: This story originally published on September 19, 2018 CNN Business — Each year, Apple CEO Tim Cook calls the next-generation iPhones the best ever made. The company’s 2018 lineup, specifically the iPhone XS and XS Max, delivers on that promise: They’re the smartest, fastest, best iPhones we’ve seen to date. But at this point, buying an updated iPhone is like getting a new Ferrari – you’ll find a faster engine, a new coat of paint, and a few new bells and whistles, but beneath all that it’s still basically the same car you could have bought last year. And just like that new Ferrari, these new iPhones are going to cost you a lot of money. The 5.8-inch iPhone XS, due in stores on Friday, starts at $999. Its 6.5-inch big sister, the iPhone XS Max, which launches on the same day, costs $100 more. Want the fully souped-up Max, with 512 GB of storage? That’ll cost you $1,449. The “affordable” iPhone XR ($749) ships next month. All of this is a lot to pay for a mostly incremental upgrade, especially now that upgrading isn’t always necessary, since iPhones hold up so much better than they used to. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy one. The XS and XS Max are worthy upgrades with impressive features. Whether or not either model is for you is up to your needs – and, more importantly, your budget. Note: If you’ve been reading this as the “X” S and “X” Max, tell your eyes to stop. It’s the iPhone 10S and 10S Max. Don’t worry, we’ve been saying it wrong all week, too. What to expect with the iPhone XS and XS Max The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max’s internals are nearly identical: With each, you get a 12 megapixel camera, better-sounding speakers and the ability to pack two SIM cards into one device – a solid perk for international travelers or people who have to switch between a device for work and one for personal use. The phones come with Apple’s new A12 bionic chip, which helps power complex augmented reality apps and what makes Face ID and games load faster. Apple played up the speed of these new phones during its product announcement, and they are fast. But so were the models before them. The back of the iPhone XS Max. Bloomberg / Getty Images Both models feature gorgeous OLED screens that make watching videos, especially on the XS Max, totally immersive. Battery life is also improved on both devices. Apple (AAPL) says you can squeeze about 30 minutes longer on the XS compared to last year’s X, and 90 minutes longer on the Max. It’s not a game changer, but we’ll take any extra minutes we can get. There is one major difference between the iPhone XS and XS Max: size. The Max is unquestionably big, but it’s technically the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus. The edge-to-edge screen creates the illusion the device itself is 21% larger than its predecessor, but it’ll fit in your hands just as easily (or not) as older Plus models. But it’s hard to shake the feeling that the device is big just to be big. Unlike the Samsung (SSNLF) Galaxy Note or the iPad, the XS Max doesn’t support many features tailored for bigger screens, such as another row of apps or a side-by-side display that lets you use two apps at once. It’s a missed opportunity. The real star of the new models is the camera. A new feature called Smart HDR shoots a four-frame buffer taken at different exposures and settings and blends them together to create more detailed shots – similar to an existing feature on the Google Pixel 2. CNNMoney But the likely fan favorite feature is a change to the iPhone’s Portrait Mode that lets you change the depth of a photo after you take it, allowing you to have more creative control. For example, you can snap a shot of a friend on a beach and blur the background for an artsy feel. If you decide later you want to see more of the ocean, you can adjust the background via the edit button. It’s an impressively-executed feature, but the results also depend on your photo skills and the lighting. When it’s good, it’s really good. When it’s not, you’ll still get a decent-looking picture. The Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S9 offer a similar feature, too. The XS and XS Max come with headphones, but unlike last year, you won’t find an adapter included in the box. This means you’ll need to spend $9 more for a dongle if you want to use an old pair of headphones. It’s Apple’s way of saying it’s finally time to get over the fact there’s no longer a headphone jack. Should you buy an iPhone XS or XS Max? It may be hard to wrap your mind around spending nearly a grand or more on a new iPhone. Although Apple quietly discontinued some of its lower-cost devices, including the iPhone 6S, iPhone SE and the iPhone X, it still sells two older models – iPhone 7 ($449) and the iPhone 8 ($599) – at cheaper price points, if you want a replacement device without splurging for the XS line. If you’re not in the market for another iPhone, can’t afford one or just can’t bring yourself to spend the money, consider upgrading your existing software to iOS 12 to make it feel new again. Try the buzzy new Screen Time tool, which logs just how obsessed you are with your iPhone. (It took me less than two hours to realize I access apps like Instagram way too much.) The feature also lets you set timers for how long you want to use certain apps. The Memoji feature lets you customize an animated emoji cartoon to look like you. CNNMoney But not all iOS 12 features translate to older models. Memoji, an animated emoji cartoon you can customize to look like you, requires users to access an iPhone with Face ID to create and send one to a friend. If you’re on the fence, consider the iPhone XS or XS Max as a several-year investment. After all, we’re moving away from the two-year replacement cycle as these devices get more durable. It’s a big reason why Apple can justify the higher price tags. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the price of the iPhone XR.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180919093447-apple-iphone-xs-max-1.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2250,w_3998,c_fill/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/bitcoin-mining-ipo/index.html?section=money_technology|Bitcoin mining IPOs are coming at a really tricky time|Bitcoin's big stock market debut is coming at a bad time. Three of the world's top makers of cryptocurrency technology are planning to sell shares, giving investors a new way to bet on digital currencies. They're reportedly hoping to raise billions of dollars. Unlike the dollar or the euro, which are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are based on computer code. Bitcoin, for example, is created and traded through the "mining" process in which computer algorithms solve increasingly complex math problems. Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, which are all based in China, make money by selling the high-tech parts and systems that power this mining. Together, they dominate the business. But the three companies operate in a young, unpredictable industry and are planning their IPOs in Hong Kong in brutal market conditions. The price of bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 in December, has since plunged by about two-thirds. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum have plummeted, too. "If the market price of cryptocurrencies suddenly falls ... demand for our mining hardware and cryptocurrency mining services will also drop rapidly," Bitmain warned potential investors this week. On top of that, Hong Kong's stock market, where the companies plan to list, entered a bear market this month, having plunged more than 20% from its previous peak because of concerns about China's economic slowdown and trade war with the United States. The mining technology companies haven't said when exactly they plan to go public or how much they're seeking to raise. Bitmain and Canaan declined interview requests, while Ebang didn't respond to a request. "These firms might be looking to cash out before the market takes an even steeper nosedive," said Benjamin Quinlan, founder of Hong Kong-based financial services consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. He points out that cryptocurrencies are slowly gaining more acceptance among mainstream investors despite recent setbacks, and that the three mining companies' revenues are still growing. But the industry faces major challenges. A key one is how governments go about regulating digital currencies. Last year, China banned most activities involving bitcoin. The country is still thought to be home to a significant number of cryptocurrency mining operations, but authorities have been trying to push them out. Cryptocurrency miners need huge amounts of electricity to run their rooms full of computing equipment around the clock. Some public utilities in the United States are already introducing higher tariffs specifically for miners. "Increasing the cost of bitcoin mining will decrease the demand for mining equipment, hindering the performance of these companies," Quinlan said. Mining cryptocurrencies is already less lucrative than it used to be. Bitcoin mining activity has exploded over the past year, boosting demand for the technology. But that means the profits from mining are spread more thinly across a greater number of users. That could hit future demand for mining equipment. Will the mining boom last? Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang were all profitable in their most recent financial year, according to documents setting out their intention to go public. But staying in the black will be a "massive challenge," said Leilei Wang, a Shanghai-based consultant at research firm Kapronasia. The companies are aware of the risks they face and are trying to adapt. For example, they say they are increasing investment in more advanced chip technology that can be used in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and connected devices. Although the Chinese government has a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in general, it's eager to bulk up the country's technological prowess in areas like computer chips. Chinese companies are still largely reliant on foreign chip technology, especially from the United States. "Whether [the cryptocurrency companies] are able to successfully pivot remains to be seen," Wang said. For now, their fate is tied to that of the wider industry. "Cryptocurrencies will likely fall out of favor" without greater mainstream adoption in the near future, Quinlan predicted. The mining equipment makers "will find it extremely difficult to survive when the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, withers away," he said. But bitcoin bulls are still hopeful that the currency can stage a recovery as financial exchanges and big companies start to take it more seriously. "As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up," Mike Novogratz, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNN this week.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180927090807-01-bitcoin-illustration-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/technology/uber-settlement-data-breach/index.html?section=money_technology|Uber to pay record $148 million over 2016 data breach|Uber will pay $148 million to settle an investigation into a 2016 data breach that the company was accused of intentionally concealing. The settlement with attorneys general for all 50 states and Washington, DC, will be split among the states. It's the largest ever multi-state data breach settlement, according to the New York attorney general. The investigation was called to look into allegations that the ride-share company violated state-level notification laws by intentionally withholding that hackers stole the personal information of 57 million users in 2016. The breach wasn't disclosed until late 2017, when Uber revealed that it paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data. In April, Uber settled a case with the Federal Trade Commission, which was investigating claims that Uber deceived customers over this breach. As part of the settlement, Uber has agreed to develop and implement a corporate integrity program for employees to report unethical behavior. It also agreed to adopt model data breach notification and data security practices, as well as hire an independent third party to assess its data security practices. "This record settlement should send a clear message: we have zero tolerance for those who skirt the law and leave consumer and employee information vulnerable to exploitation," said New York attorney general Barbara D. Underwood said in a press release. New York will get about $5.1 million of the payout. "Our current management team's decision to disclose the incident was not only the right thing to do, it embodies the principles by which we are running our business today: transparency, integrity, and accountability," said Uber chief legal officer Tony West in a blog post on Wednesday. "We'll continue to invest in protections to keep our customers and their data safe and secure, and we're committed to maintaining a constructive and collaborative relationship with governments around the world." The settlement comes as Uber attempts to clean up its practices. In July, for example, Uber finally hired a chief privacy officer: Ruby Zefo, became Uber's top executive focused on privacy. Matt Olsen also joined as chief trust and security officer.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180530094830-uber-badge-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/11/investing/inflation-protection/index.html?section=money_pf|How can I protect my investments from inflation?|How can I protect my investments against inflation? Even as your investments increase in value, inflation can eat away at what they’re worth. There are things investors can do to hedge the immediate effects of inflation, or earn a return that outpaces inflation over time. But it can be hard to predict. “After-inflation returns are the only ones that matter for investors in the real world,” says Robinson Crawford, an investment adviser with Montebello Avenue. Even if inflation is currently rising more slowly than analysts predicted, it’s better to be prepared. Stocks Financial advisers say one of the most consistent hedges against inflation is a properly diversified stock portfolio. Equities have historically outpaced inflation, says Sean C. Gillespie, a financial planner with Redeployment Wealth Strategies says that while there is inherent volatility in a stock portfolio, “equities are a long-term asset for your plan just like inflation is a long-term threat.” To figure out where to put your money in the stock market, investors could look to a total return strategy that relies on equities to provide positive inflation-adjusted returns over the long term. “Of course, investors have to accept more risk when investing in stocks and endure periods when the returns have not outpaced inflation,” says Dejan Ilijevski, an investment adviser at Sabela Capital Markets. “Although some investors may assume that higher inflation leads to lower stock performance, US market history shows that nominal annual stock returns are unrelated to inflation.” Gold and commodities Gold and commodities have been standard havens from inflation for investors. “Traditionally commodities and gold have been good inflation hedges,” says Stephanie Bucko, a chartered financial analyst and co-founder of Mana Financial Life Design. But she says it is important to take into account the US dollar’s strength as part of this equation. “We like oil exposure, as this impacts our clients on a day-to-day basis related to gas prices, but it also provides a good inflation hedge,” says Bucko, adding that we saw this in the 1970s as inflation doubled and nominal oil prices skyrocketed. But commodity markets, for the unfamiliar, can be complex and risky. “Commodities are volatile, more so than stocks, which means that adding commodities to a portfolio may increase real return volatility, offsetting the benefits of hedging,” says Ilijevski. Real estate Real estate is the ultimate hard asset in times of inflation since it will see price appreciation. Financial advisers suggest investors find a place for real estate in a portfolio. Investors can gain exposure to real estate by directly owning commercial or residential property, or by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). Real estate is a sound investment, says Crawford. “But I would caution that if you’re not increasing rent in your real estate, you aren’t fighting inflation.” Short term bonds and TIPS Short-term bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are investments that are a hedge against inflation. “Hedging seeks out asset classes that tend to positively correlate with inflation,” says Ilijevski. For example, he says, short-term maturities allow bond-holders to more frequently roll over the principal at higher interest rates. This helps inflation-sensitive investors keep up with short-term inflation. Similarly, TIPS, issued by the government, are also a fixed-income security hedge against inflation. Their principle is adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. When CPI rises, the principle increases, resulting in higher interest payments. “TIPS absolutely merit a place in a US investor’s portfolio, especially those with significant bond holdings,” says Crawford. “The main issue is that they increase in value in conjunction with the CPI, which many would argue is not an accurate inflation measure.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180214143219-cnnmoneyinflation.jpg?q=x_3,y_281,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/pf/retirement-catch-up/index.html?section=money_pf|How to catch up on retirement savings in your 50s|If you're nearing retirement age and your savings are looking a little sparse, you're not alone. Forty-six percent of baby boomers don't have anything stashed away for retirement, according to a study from the Insured Retirement Institute, which means nearly half of soon-to-be retirees need to supercharge their savings if they don't want to work the rest of their lives. The bad news is that if you're in your 50s and are just now starting to save, it's going to be a tough road ahead to save enough to enjoy a comfortable retirement. The good news is that it can be done, and even if you can't save half a million dollars by the time you turn 65, you can put away a decent chunk of change — which is far better than nothing. Picking up steam after a late start One advantage workers in their 50s have over younger employees is the benefit of catch-up 401(k) and IRA contributions. If you're under age 50, the 2018 annual contribution limit for 401(k)s and IRAs is $18,500 and $5,500, respectively. But for those age 50 and over, the annual limits are $24,500 and $6,500. While that's a fantastic benefit to take advantage of if you can, chances are if you're struggling to save for retirement, it's not going to be feasible to suddenly start saving nearly $25,000 per year. In that case, the best thing to do is determine what you can save, set a goal for yourself, and stick with it. The first step is to create a thorough budget of all your monthly expenses to see where your cash is going and how much you have left to save at the end of the month. This is also a good time to see where you can make cuts. Be honest with yourself here to decide how important these expenses are compared to retirement. Ask yourself if you absolutely have to be eating out every week or whether you really need to take the family on a fancy vacation each summer. If you're especially serious about saving, you may even choose to downsize to a smaller home to potentially save hundreds of dollars per month on your mortgage. Once you know roughly how much you'll have to contribute to your retirement fund each month, start crunching some numbers. Retirement calculators are helpful in giving you an estimate of how much your savings will amount to by the time you retire as well as how much you'll likely need to have saved by retirement. Keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates, but they can give you a rough idea of where you stand and how long your savings will last. If your numbers aren't where you want them to be, don't get discouraged. Saving is hard work, and beating yourself up over the fact that you didn't start saving earlier won't make it any easier. If you've trimmed your monthly expenses as much as you can and are still struggling to save, you have a couple other options. Making the most of Social Security One option to consider is to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which will result in fatter checks each month. You're able to start claiming benefits as early as age 62, but for every year you delay past your full retirement age (FRA), or the age at which you receive 100% of the benefit amount you're entitled to, you'll receive a boost in benefits. For example, if your FRA is 67 and you wait to claim until age 70, you'll receive an additional 24% on top of the full 100% you're entitled to. If you're already going to be strapped for cash during retirement, this extra money can make a major difference. For example, say your FRA is 67 and the full amount you're entitled to (or the amount you'll receive if you wait until age 67 to claim) is $1,200. If you instead delay claiming until you reach age 70, you'll be receiving $1,488 per month. An extra $288 per month may not seem like a significant difference, but it adds up to nearly $3,500 over a year — which is a lot of money when you're trying to make each dollar count. In addition to waiting to claim Social Security, you can also put off retirement by a few years and continue working as long as you can. This isn't the most exciting option, but it can help you save a lot of money in a relatively short period of time. Because not only are you continuing to contribute to your retirement fund as you work, you're also not draining your savings just yet. For example, say you're 50 years old with zero savings and you want to retire at 65. If you're contributing $300 per month and earning a 7% annual rate of return on your investments, you'll have a total of $93,859 saved after 15 years. While that's a good amount of money (and far better than nothing), it will likely only last you a few years during retirement. If, however, you delay retirement by 10 years and work until 75, continuing to contribute $300 per month earning a 7% return, you'll end up with $236,241. And if you also wait until age 70 to claim Social Security, you'll receive a boost in benefits there as well. If your employer offers matching 401(k) contributions, you stand to earn even more by working a few more years. In this situation, if your employer matches your $300 monthly contribution, bringing your total contributions to $600 per month, you'll end up with $472,482 by age 75, compared to just $187,718 had you retired at 65.

Some people go to great lengths to set up their spending, saving and investment goals so they can retire early. For Justin McCurry — who retired at age 33 with $1.3 million so he could spend more time traveling with his wife and three kids — retirement came more than 30 years early. And not by accident. While the main goal is figuring how much you'll need and reaching that magic number, there are other considerations, too. Hitting that number can be so exciting you want to launch right away, says McCurry. But not paying attention to details of your post-working life can undermine or even undo some of the hard work you've done, he says. Check your math and your risk First, you're going to need to tally up your expenses, think about what kind of lifestyle you want to live, and come up with a number for how much yearly income you think you'll need. But the tricky part is figuring out how big of a nest egg you need to save to provide that income. A classic retirement rule of thumb is the "4% rule." It means if you have 25 times your annual expenses saved, you can expect to withdraw 4% a year and not outlive your portfolio. But that formula is based on someone retiring in their 60s and living for roughly another 30 years. Retiring early means you'll be drawing down on your savings for many more years than a typical retirement. "We looked at our spending and added and subtracted items for our budget," McCurry says. Work clothes and commuting went out and travel came in. "We decided to use a 3.5% withdraw rate since we are in our 30's, to be a more conservative." His family of five now lives on $40,000 a year. Arrange for cash flow Since early withdrawal from traditional retirement vehicles like IRAs and 401(k)s will incur penalty fees, early retirees need to figure out how to regularly get money with the least adversity. A substantially equal periodic payment (SEPP) plan allows you to withdraw about 3-4% of your money annually before age 59½ without incurring tax or early withdrawal penalties. Although bound by a strict IRS formula, there are three methods used to determine the payout. These payments, once started, will continue for five years or until you are 59½, whichever is later. While it can work well if you're bridging a short gap between retiring and age 60, McCurry didn't think it would work for him. "I was 33 when I left work," he says, "I didn't want to lock myself into a fixed annual pay out for the next 27 years." Instead, he set up a Roth IRA conversion ladder. The IRS allows money converted from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to be withdrawn penalty free and tax free. The catch is you need to wait five years. If you convert $30,000 in 2018 (and pay any tax owed), you can with draw $30,000 in 2023. By annually converting an amount to withdraw in five years, you can build a ladder of income. Prepare for health care Health care is not only a major expense, but it's also unpredictable: both your health and the system. With years to go before Medicare kicks in, you'll need to purchase your own health insurance. That can be expensive. But retirement also reduces your income, which could qualify you for some kind of help. McCurry and his family get coverage through the Affordable Care Act and, given their income and the size of their family, they even earn a subsidy of nearly $10,000 dollars. Set up your housing A change in where you live can make a huge difference in your costs, says McCurry. "People usually live where they live because their job took them there," he says. "But they say 'I can't afford to retire here.'" Consider downsizing, or moving to where housing costs less. Set up your new residence before retirement, McCurry advises. Even if you plan to travel for a while right after retiring, it could be worth it to arrange for your future home before you go — maybe even earn passive income from renting it out. "Maybe you want to pay cash, but if not it will be easier to get a lease or a mortgage when you are working," says McCurry. "Sure, you can show a $2 million balance sheet to a mortgage broker, but they can still say they need to see your income." Stress test your plan Don't forget to account for other unknowns, like inflation and market returns. "We often run multiple scenarios with different assumptions — for inflation or growth rates, for example," says Jennifer B. Harper, a certified financial planner and director of Bridge Financial Planning. Then she says she applies a "Monte Carlo" analysis, a model that looks at multiple outcomes to provide a probability distribution or risk assessment for an investment, to show ranges of potential projections. "It's not perfect," she says, "but it's a heck of a lot better than modeling straight line growth for everything."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180212093404-retire-early-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/pf/retire-as-early-as-you-can/index.html?section=money_pf|3 reasons to retire as early as you can|Would you love to retire early? So many people have that goal, and for a variety of reasons. For some, it's a matter of escaping a tough work schedule and the pressures that come with it. For others, it's an opportunity to spend quality time with family and pursue hobbies. Many folks, however, have a hard time with the notion of retiring early, whether it be from a place of financial insecurity or guilt. But if early retirement appeals to you on any level, here are three reasons to go for it. 1. You can afford it Many folks slack in the retirement savings department all their lives. Case in point: The average American aged 50 to 55 has $124,831 socked away for the future, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which isn't a whole lot at that stage of life. When we apply a 4% annual withdrawal rate to that balance, which is what countless financial experts recommend, that results in just under $5,000 of income per year. Of course, there's also Social Security to factor in, but the point is that many older Americans are woefully unprepared for retirement from a savings perspective. If you're not one of them, however, then there's no reason you shouldn't feel comfortable retiring ahead of your peers. Let's imagine that instead of being in your early to mid-50s with roughly $125,000, you're sitting on $2 million instead. Now you don't want to start withdrawing from your nest egg at a rate of 4% per year if you're retiring in your 50s, because that formula is designed to ensure that your savings don't run out for 30 years, and chances are, you'll live into your 90s and will therefore need them to last longer than that. But even if we slash that withdrawal rate in half to 2%, you're still looking at $40,000 per year in retirement income from your nest egg alone. And that, coupled with Social Security and other income sources, might allow you to live a very comfortable lifestyle. 2. You can still earn money Many people view retirement as a period where you stop working. But actually, retirement is the ideal period to start a business or turn a favorite hobby into a money-making opportunity. If you're worried that you can't afford to retire because your nest egg isn't all that robust, but want the ability to live on your own terms and control your own schedule, then it certainly pays to quit your job and do something else to make a living instead. And remember, the more fulfilling you find your work, the more motivated you'll be to keep at it. 3. It'll be good for your health There are studies out there that show that working longer can lead to a longer life. Not only does going into an office offer mental and physical benefits, but the social aspect alone can make plugging away for longer a worthwhile option to consider. On the other hand, the wrong job can easily put you in a situation where your work is harming your health. Excessive stress has been unequivocally linked to high blood pressure and heart disease, while being too sedentary (which tends to be the case for office workers chained to their desks for hours on end) can cause weight gain and other medical issues. Therefore, if you believe that your health will improve once you stop working, that's reason enough to retire sooner rather than later. Or, to put it another way, the longer you stay at a job that's harmful to your health, the more you risk passing away at an early age and missing out on retirement altogether.

But if you have the power to make early retirement work for you, it certainly pays to leave the workforce prematurely and enjoy the lifestyle you've dreamed about for ages.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180212093404-retire-early-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/18/autos/audi-etron-electric-suv/index.html?section=money_autos|Audi E-Tron, a new all-electric SUV, is unveiled|Joining a growing number of luxury auto makers, Audi unveiled a new all-electric SUV. Called the E-Tron, the SUV will be available in Europe later this year and in the United States next spring. Audi said it is taking refundable $1,000 deposits for the E-Tron starting now. Prices will start at about $75,000 or $86,700 for well-equipped "First Edition" models. It's the first of three new electric vehicles Audi will introduce over the next few years. The German luxury automaker, which is part of the Volkswagen Group (VLKPF), also announced it is partnering with Amazon to handle installation of home charging stations for E-Tron buyers. The E-Tron was revealed at an event on the San Francisco waterfront. Hundreds of drones formed Audi's four ring logo over a former Ford factory turned event space. The SUV was unveiled here because the E-Tron was designed with the US market especially on mind, Audi executives said. While it might not generate the excitement of a Tesla unveiling -- that company received hundreds of thousands of dollars in deposits for its Model 3 within hours of that car's debut -- the E-Tron increases the competitive pressure. The E-Tron follows Jaguar's I-Pace electric SUV. Mercedes and BMW also recently unveiled electric SUVs that will go on sale within the next couple of years. These offerings are all SUVs mostly because the market, in general, has shifted heavily in that direction. "We wanted to be in the SUV space because we saw the growth and we wanted to be in the sweet spot of the market," said Filip Brabec, Audi's vice president for product development. Car shoppers considering an electric car today are no longer interested in their vehicle looking radically different from anything else on the road, said Brabec. The E-Tron looks, quite clearly, like an Audi SUV. It even has Audi's famous trapezoidal grill, a key branding feature, despite not needing a radiator. The grill allows air to pass through under the battery to provide some additional cooling. There are some unique attributes, though. The E-Tron stands a little wider than Audi's other SUVs. Slats running across the rear bumper draw attention to the car's lack of tailpipes, while there are lights in the front that are designed to look like the bars of a charge status indicator. In Europe, the E-Tron won't have traditional side mirrors. Instead, it will have a camera on each side where mirrors would ordinarily be. The views from those cameras will be displayed on screens inside the vehicle. That system will not be available in the United States because safety regulations here don't allow for it. Audi executives said they are working with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to bring this feature to the American market. With two electric motors, the all-wheel-drive SUV can accelerate from zero to 60 miles an hour in 5.5 seconds and it has a top speed of 124 miles an hour. It will be able to tow as much as 4,000 pounds. Audi has not yet announced what its driving range will be on a full charge. When the E-Tron is cruising, rather than accelerating, it is driven mostly by the rear motor. Engineers put a heavy emphasis on recuperating as much energy as possible while driving. That's generally done as a vehicle brakes or slows by allowing the wheels to push the electric motors, which then act as generators. In the E-Tron, the driver will be able to select how aggressively the car uses this system, allowing for "one pedal" driving in which taking pressure off the accelerator pedal will slow the car to a full stop using only the motors. As with other Audi vehicles, the driver will also be able to select different driving modes, from comfortable to sporty, that will alter suspension stiffness, steering responsiveness and how aggressively the SUV accelerates. The SUVs ground clearance is also adjustable by as much as three inches. Buyers will be able to purchase a home charging system and have it installed by Amazon Home Services. The installation can be ordered online. Pricing will vary depending on each homeowner's needs. Audi plans to release two more electric vehicles in the next two years and a total of 12 by 2025.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180917154958-01-audi-e-tron-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/23/news/companies/vw-volkswagen-mexico-drought/index.html?section=money_autos|VW accused of ruining Mexican crops with weather-altering technology|Volkswagen has been accused of ruining crops planted near one of its factories in Mexico by using technology to alter the weather. Local groups have accused the German automaker of causing a dry spell with hail cannons that shoot sonic booms into the air to prevent the formation of hail. The devices are used to protect cars parked outside the factory from dents caused by hailstones. Following the complaints, Volkswagen has promised to reduce its use of the cannons at its Puebla factory. "Even though there is no evidence that the use of these devices causes a lack of rain, Volkswagen (VLKAF) of Mexico decided to modify its operation in order to maintain a harmonious relationship with its neighbors," a company spokesperson told CNN. "Volkswagen ... [has stopped] using these devices in their automatic mode, and is only operating them manually, when the meteorological conditions determine the imminent fall of hail," she said. The automaker said it now plans to install "anti-hail nets" over more than 150 acres to protect its cars. It said it would continue to use the cannons if needed. The automaker has around 15,000 workers at the Puebla factory, which manufactures models including the Jetta, Beetle, Tiguan and Golf. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles are produced at the plant each year. Local activists said the cannons had damaged crops in the region. "We are happy to know that as a group we have raised our voices against the use of hail cannons by VW Mexico," one group said in a statement posted on Facebook (FB). Mike Eggers, the owner of a hail cannon manufacturer in New Zealand, said the technology is often incorrectly blamed for stopping rain. "In reality, the technology isn't around rain, it's around hail. And there's a difference. A substantial difference," he said. The cannons have been used for decades, most often to protect crops. -- Marilia Brocchetto, Claudia Rebaza and Max Ramsay contributed reporting.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180823093426-02-volkswagen-cars-mexico-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/news/companies/elon-musk-tesla-analysis/index.html?section=money_autos|Elon Musk is hurting Tesla with his bizarre behavior|Investors should be focusing on Tesla's growing sales and ambitious plans to reinvent the American automotive world. They should be salivating over its exciting plans for semi trucks for big corporate fleets and its alternative energy initiatives. And they should be reassured by analysts' predictions that Tesla will report a profit in the fourth quarter and a full year of profitability in 2019. Instead, they are watching CEO Elon Musk smoke a blunt with Joe Rogan. They're looking at an easy punchline for comedians, a man who's become a walking Page Six item. They're seeing rapper Azealia Banks' bizarre Instagram posts alleging that she was in Musk's house while he tweeted on acid, reading him tearfully talking to the New York Times about his Ambien use and making baseless accusations about a diver in the Thai cave rescue. It's an even bigger problem considering the brain drain that's now going on at Tesla. Chief accounting officer Dave Morton is leaving Tesla after just a month on the job, citing concerns about "the level of public attention placed on the company." And in an email to employees Friday, Musk said chief people officer Gaby Toledano was extending her leave of absence to "spend more time with her family and has decided to continue doing so for personal reasons." All of this wackiness is taking its toll on Tesla's (TSLA) stock. Shares fell about 6% Friday. They are now down more than 15% this year and are more than 30% below the all-time high they hit last year. The Musk circus is a problem for Wall Street. "Musk is not going to be conventional. Breaking the mold is part of his PR strategy," wrote Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster in a blog post Friday. Munster added that he suspects Tesla's board is trying to put controls in place to limit Musk's outlandish behavior. But he says it's clear Musk has a different plan. And that's a big problem. "At times, Musk appears to be working against himself," Munster wrote. "At the core, we believe he wants to prove his doubters wrong, but many of his actions strengthen the case against him." Musk should delete his Twitter account, stop talking about the Thai rescuer and not use pot in a public setting, Munster said. He may need to do even more than that. To paraphrase George Washington in the hit musical "Hamilton," Tesla is a powder keg about to explode and Musk needs another person to help him lighten the load. Tesla has to hire a chief operating officer. Yes, Musk may be difficult to work with. But another company he runs, SpaceX, has a highly regarded COO in Gwynne Shotwell. Shotwell has worked at SpaceX since 2002 and was one of the firm's first employees. She was named president and COO in late 2008. So it's clearly not impossible to get along with Musk for a long period of time in a professional setting. And you don't hear stories about how Musk is sleeping at SpaceX. He's only doing that at Tesla. Maybe if he had someone like Shotwell to help him out, he'd be able to catch a few more zzzs. Tesla investors would certainly sleep a heck of a lot easier too.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180905100235-01-elon-musk-file-061418-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/11/technology/andrew-left-citron-tesla-elon-musk/index.html?section=money_autos|Short seller: Why it might be time for Elon Musk to step down from Tesla|A prominent short seller who is suing Tesla and Elon Musk for manipulating its stock price says the company would be better off without Musk as the CEO. Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research, told CNN's Julia Chatterley on "First Move" Tuesday morning that it might make sense for Musk to have a more strategic or visionary role at Tesla (TSLA). He said the company could bring in someone else to run the day to day operations. Left said it would have seemed like "death to the company" a few months ago to think Tesla might need someone else to run it. But Musk has courted controversy as of late. Recently Musk has smoked marijuana during a video interview and accused a caver in the Thai rescue of a stranded soccer team of being a pedophile. Last week, Left filed a class action lawsuit that accuses Musk of securities fraud after he tweeted in August that he had "funding secured" for a plan to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Musk has since abandoned the plan. Left argued that the tweet was an attempt to "burn" short sellers who are betting against the company. "Musk has a long-standing public feud with short-sellers and often uses his personal Twitter account to taunt and confront skeptics of his company," Left noted in the lawsuit. On Tuesday, Left conceded that his short position on Tesla has been wrong so far. The stock, despite recent volatility, has soared over the past few years. "Rumors of their death have been greatly exaggerated and talked about many times," Left said, But Left told Chatterley he thinks that at the end of the day, Tesla is going to need more cash and it will probably have to sell more stock to raise funding. That would be bad news for existing shareholders. Shares fell 2% Tuesday and are now down more than 20% in the past month.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180911102207-andrew-left-citron-research-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/23/news/companies/tesla-ark-elon-musk-private/index.html?section=money_autos|Investor tells Musk stock could be worth $4,000|Elon Musk thinks he could take Tesla private at $420 a share. But one Tesla investor thinks that's a bad idea -- because the stock could be worth nearly ten times that amount in the most optimistic of scenarios. Cathie Wood, CEO of money management firm ARK Invest, wrote an open letter to Musk earlier this week saying that Tesla could be valued somewhere between $700 and $4,000 per share in five years. Wood tweeted out a link for the letter to Elon Musk Wednesday night. Musk responded in less than an hour, telling Wood "thank you for the thoughtful letter." In an interview with CNNMoney Thursday, Wood said that Tesla's investor relations responded quickly to her letter as well and passed it on to the board, but the board has not gotten back to her as of yet. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged after Musk's now infamous "funding secured" tweet earlier this month, hitting a peak of $387.46 in the process. But the stock has since slid back to about $320 due to growing skepticism about Musk's ability to actually get a deal done. Going private now would be a mistake Still, Wood argues that Musk should resist the urge to go private, even if he could pull a deal off. "Taking Tesla private today at $420 per share would undervalue it greatly, depriving many investors of the opportunity to participate in its success," she wrote. Wood argues that Tesla could evolve beyond the relatively low profit business of making electric cars. She envisions a Tesla that is generating fat profit margins from autonomous taxis, drones, energy storage services and a bigger presence in China. If Tesla is able to do all that, the stock could eventually hit her $4,000 target. But Wood admits it will take time -- and patience on the part of shareholders. She realizes that some Tesla shareholders are impatient. "Because of the short-term investment time horizon of investors in the public markets and inflated valuations in the private markets today, I understand why you may want to take Tesla private, but I must try to dissuade you," she said. Tesla is either the largest or second largest holding in three ETFs run by ARK, according to Wood -- the ARK Innovation (ARKK), ARK Industrial Innovation (ARKQ) and the ARK Web x.0 (ARKW) funds. Shorter leash if Tesla went private? Wood thinks there are other investors out there like her that would be willing to give Musk a chance to make his vision a reality. "If you do not take Tesla private, you will be surprised and gratified at investor reaction once they realize and understand the scope and ramifications of your long-term vision," she said, adding "with time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets." She pointed to Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce (CRM) as other companies with visionary leaders whose stock prices have soared. Wood also said if Tesla went private, it may have fewer investors, which actually could make life tougher for Musk. "Please do not let the short-term thinking of professional public equity investors persuade you to take Tesla private," she said. "I believe you will be on a much shorter leash in the private markets and will deprive a broad and loyal investor base of one of the most important investment opportunities of their lifetimes," Wood wrote at the end of the letter. Wood added in the interview with CNNMoney that she understands many Tesla bears are skeptical of her extremely bullish $4,000 target. But she said that "even if we are half right, the stock could double."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180820111342-gfx-elon-musk-twitter-stock-down-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/04/autos/pebble-beach-record-auction-cars/index.html?section=money_autos|Most valuable car ever auctioned to go on sale later this month|One collector car auction in California this month could potentially set three separate auto auction records: The most valuable car ever auctioned, the most valuable British car and, just possibly, the most valuable American car ever auctioned. The days leading up to the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance classic car show in Monterey, California, are filled with events for high-end car collectors, including auctions at which record prices are frequently paid for the most desirable cars. On August 25, the day before the Concours, a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO estimated to be worth between $45 million and $60 million will be auctioned at RM Sotheby's annual Monterey sale. If the selling price even approaches this estimate, it will set a record for any car ever sold at auction. Another 1962-63 Ferrari GTO sold for $38 million at a Bonhams auction at Pebble Beach Car Week in 2014. (The car had two model years because it was nearly destroyed in a fatal crash and was rebuilt by Ferrari.) For now, that remains the current record holder for a car sold at auction. Cars have sold for far more in private transactions rather than at public auctions. The vast majority of collector cars are sold privately. Another Ferrari 250 GTO, a 1963 model, was recently privately sold for the widely reported price of $70 million. Related: The classic car industry could be hurt by tariffs Classic Ferrari GTOs are extraordinarily valuable for a number of reasons. First, they were, and are, simply very beautiful cars. Second, these were some of Ferrari's most successful racing cars. There have been more successful models, such as the 250 LM, which has its engine mounted behind the driver, but the front-engined GTO is more popular because it's easier to live with and drive. "The 250 GTO, you open the door like you do on your car, you get in and you go," said RM Sotheby's car specialist Jake Auerbach. "It really is that simple." All 36 of the 250 GTOs ever made are still running and their ownership has created a very exclusive club. Ferrari 250 owners know one another and sometimes get together for road rallies. "The GTO tours are, as far as that level of net worth goes, the ultimate event and there really is only one way to get in and that's to own one of the 36 cars," said Aurbach. The GTO being sold at the RM Sotheby's auction on August 25 won the 1962 Italian GT championship, and had over 15 race victories from 1962 to 1965. Among its drivers were Phil Hill, who is most famous as the first American to be a Formula 1 World Champion. He drove this Ferrari as his practice car before the Targa Florio race in 1962. Gianni Bulgari, later president of his family's jewelry company, raced the car in 1963. Another car being sold at the RM Sotheby's auction, a 1963 Aston Martin DP215 Grand Touring Competition Prototype, is expected to be the most valuable British car ever sold at auction. It's estimated to be worth $18 million to $20 million. In its brief racing career, it never won a race but it did set a speed record on the track at Le Mans. It still stands as an important part of British automotive history. Related: Firm that designed Ferraris will make 250 mph electric supercar The current record holder for the most valuable British car ever auctioned was also an Aston Martin, a 1956 DBR1 that was sold at RM Sotheby's Monterey auction last year. The American car that will also cross the auction block, a 1966 Ford GT40, would have to sell for more than its estimated value to set a record but, given the car and its history, that's possible. The gold-colored race car finished third at the 24-hour Le Mans in France in 1966, one of the most famous car races in history. After being rebuffed in an attempt to buy Ferrari years before, Ford CEO Henry Ford II had demanded the company beat Ferrari on the track. This was Ford's moment of triumph. "It doesn't really get any better in American racing, full stop, than 1966 Le Mans," Aurbach said. A movie about that race, "Ford vs. Ferrari" starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, is slated for release next year. The cars that finished first and second at that race are unlikely to ever come up for sale, Aurbach said. The availability of this car represents "a generational opportunity," he said. The race car's value is estimated to be $9 million to $12 million. To date, the most valuable American car ever auctioned was the very first Shelby Cobra built by Carroll Shelby in 1962. That car sold for $13.8 million at RM Sotheby's Monterey auction in 2016.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180802143331-rm-sothebys-1962-ferrari-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/02/news/companies/fuel-economy-auto-industry-uncertainty/index.html?section=money_autos|For auto industry, weaker fuel economy rules would mean a world of chaos|The Trump administration's proposed rollback of auto fuel economy and emissions standards looks, on the surface, like a welcome gift to the auto industry. It's more like federal regulators just handed the auto industry a great big box of chaos. The best outcome will be earnest negotiations to reach a new set of standards everyone can agree on. What's likely is a long period of uncertainty. And this at time when the auto industry is pouring billions of dollars into figuring out its future path — one that revolves around electric vehicles, autonomous driving and a big step back from fossil fuels. Automobiles take years to conceive, design, create and test. The industry requires predictability and long time horizons. Requirements that could drastically change at unpredictable intervals can be far worse than rules that might be a little too demanding like the ones implemented under President Obama in 2012. Rebecca Lindland is an industry analyst with Kelley Blue Book and was involved in an Obama-era review of the standards. She felt, even then, that some easing of standards was warranted, she said. The problem with the increases in fuel economy envisioned under the Obama plan was that they were based on the expectation of greater consumer demand for hybrid and electric cars than actually materialized. Also, car buyers have shown an even greater demand for SUVs than anyone expected. "I would like to see a more gradual, less disruptive easing of fuel economy standards," Lindland said. The new proposal, she said, will certainly engender bitter fights. The Trump administration's proposal would essentially undo the Obama requirements. The proposed changes would freeze fuel economy and emissions standards at 2020 levels and change how emissions are regulated. Related: Trump administration wants to lower emissions standards for cars John Graham of Indiana University, who worked on fuel economy regulations during the George W. Bush administration, says some automakers would welcome the Trump administration's aggressive approach. For automakers that are further behind on meeting the Obama-era standards, any reprieve would be seen as a help. "Even if the administration loses, they may end up just having a delay in this whole program," he said. Automotive fuel economy and emissions requirements are a complex regulatory quilt. Fuel economy is regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tailpipe emissions, however, are regulated, on the federal level, by the Environmental Protection Agency. The state of California also regulates tailpipe emissions in its state, and more than a dozen other states follow its lead. That awkward mix of regulations worked just fine, more or less, for years. That was until, in 2007, courts ruled that the EPA should regulate emissions of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, which causes global warming, is different from other auto pollutants in that there is simply no way to reduce it beyond reducing the amount of fuel burned. That put the EPA into the position of, essentially, regulating fuel economy. California also wanted to regulate C02 emissions. That created the nightmare possibility, for the auto industry, of three conflicting sets of fuel economy requirements. The answer, hammered out through negotiations among NHTSA, the EPA, California and the auto industry, was the auto emissions and fuel economy rules announced in 2012. Besides halting future increases in fuel economy requirements, the Trump administration also wants to take away California's right to set its own vehicle emissions standards. This will be the biggest source of conflict. Related: With the Jaguar I-Pace, electric SUVs are off to a good start While individual automakers have yet to comment on the proposal, the largest industry groups, the Auto Alliance and the Association of Global Automakers, signaled their hope for a quick negotiated agreement. "With today's release of the Administration's proposals, it's time for substantive negotiations to begin," the groups said in a joint statement. "We urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of America's drivers." In the meantime, automakers will probably continue to increase fuel economy of their new vehicles, said Carla Bailo, head of the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/16/news/companies/tesla-elon-musk-no-coo/index.html?section=money_autos|It's time for Tesla to call in a grown-up to keep Elon Musk in check|Quick! Name the chief operating officer of Tesla. You can't. Because that was a trick question. Tesla (TSLA) has no COO. And some financial experts think that's a big problem, especially since there are so many questions about the company's future. Tesla may or may not be going private. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has forced the issue on his board because he tweeted, perhaps impulsively, that he had "funding secured" for a deal. The stock surged at first but has since fallen back to around the level it was at before the now infamous tweet. But would Musk have written it in the first place if he had a COO to rein him in? Perhaps not. Tesla lists only a chief technical officer and chief financial officer, along with Musk, as its top executives. Musk is also the company's product architect. "I look at Tesla and I see a genius in Elon Musk. But who's the general?" said Mariann Montagne, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. Having another high-profile leader that Wall Street respects, like Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook (FB) for example, could give Musk the freedom to innovate and take risks. Meanwhile, the COO could run the company's operations, letting investors breathe easy. Another senior leader may be needed now that Tesla is worth about $60 billion-- more than GM (GM) and Ford (F) and making Tesla the most valuable US auto company. "A strong COO for Tesla would probably be a positive step since, as in CEO Elon Musk's own words, it is finally 'a real car company,'" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer of Personal Capital. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment about why it does not have a COO. Others also wondered why Musk didn't have a COO or other prominent executive to help him out. "Does every company need a COO specifically? Not necessarily. But they need to have someone to tell the CEO when they are messing up," said John Wilson, head of research and corporate governance at Cornerstone Capital Group. "Is there any check on the CEO? Musk's behavior demonstrates that there doesn't appear to be," Wilson added. The lack of a COO is even more concerning to some since Musk is, to put it mildly, a very busy guy. "Musk has a lot of different irons in the fire," said Tom Plumb, CEO of Plumb Funds, referring to the two other companies he runs -- SpaceX and The Boring Company -- and the many other things on his plate. Having a COO also can reassure investors that there is a succession plan in place in case Musk decides to step down to focus more on these other initiatives. Other successful founder-led companies have cultivated deep management benches. Google, now known as Alphabet, brought in tech veteran Eric Schmidt to be CEO before its IPO, for example. Microsoft's Bill Gates had Steve Ballmer and then Satya Nadella take over. Having a trusted COO also could be helpful in case Musk ever runs into health problems. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook had been COO for several years under Steve Jobs. That meant that there was a clear succession plan once Jobs, who passed away in 2011, was no longer able to serve as CEO. What's more, Jobs had been CEO of animated studio Pixar until it was bought by Disney (DIS) while also serving as CEO of Apple. If Jobs did not have Cook at his side, Wall Street might have been more concerned about a leadership void at Apple. Kind of like how Tesla investors are now worried that Musk may be spreading himself too thin and that there's nobody else to step in and lead the company.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180605162534-elon-musk-clouds-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/08/investing/elon-musk-tesla-going-private-tweet/index.html?section=money_autos|Here's what it would take to go private|Elon Musk shocked Wall Street and Silicon Valley when he tweeted Tuesday that he wanted to take Tesla private. But can Musk really strike a deal? And what would it mean to Tesla shareholders if he succeeds? Musk said in a series of tweets that he had the funding and investor support. "Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote," Musk said in one tweet. But it may not be that simple. How would Tesla go private? It would have to buy back all of its public shares. Musk proposed an offer of $420 per share for Tesla (TSLA), or about 12% higher than where Tesla's stock was trading late Wednesday morning. That would value the company at more than $70 billion. Musk is Tesla's biggest shareholder, with a nearly 20% stake. It's unclear who Musk secured funding from. The Financial Times reported that he met with Saudi Investors, but the company has not commented. Typically investment banks provide the huge amount of capital to take a company private. But that comes with substantial risk -- and adds a huge amount of debt to a company's balance sheet. The next three largest shareholders -- investment firms T. Rowe Price, Fidelity and Baillie Gifford -- have a combined 25% stake. None of those firms would comment about Musk's proposal, but it's not clear that every investor would be on board. If those shareholders vote against the proposal the company would not go private. Musk also said that shareholders would have the option of selling their stakes or retaining their shares for partial ownership of a privately held Tesla. So that's led to confusion about how "private" Tesla would be if it kept some of its existing investors. Tesla's board said in a statement Wednesday that Musk talked to board members last week about why going private would make sense and how a deal could be funded. The board said it is now taking the "appropriate next steps" to evaluate the proposal. Will investors stick with a private Tesla? One Tesla shareholder said he thought a deal to take Tesla private was doable. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which owns 38,000 shares of Tesla, told CNNMoney he would hang on to his investment even if Tesla went private because he believes in its growth potential. Gerber noted that Musk's startup SpaceX is private, and investors -- including mutual fund giant Fidelity -- are given the chance every few months to cash out. "The structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months," Musk said in an email to employees Tuesday that was published on Tesla's corporate blog. Will going private solve Tesla's problems? Not necessarily. The company has $2.2 billion in cash and $9.5 billion in debt. If Tesla adds to its debt load to finance a buyout, rising interest rates could make it more expensive for Tesla to make payments. "The company can't afford more debt," Gerber said. Tesla could raise funds by issuing more stock, but that would dilute the company even more and make it harder to go private. The company also remains unprofitable and going private wouldn't change that. It would just allow Musk to make more investments in the company without having to worry about short-term focused investors clamoring for profits sooner rather than later. Is a deal smart given changes in tax law? That's debatable. The new tax rules enacted by Congress last year could be bad news for Tesla. The IRS now caps how much a company can deduct on interest payments for corporate debt. That's a key reason why Michael Dell decided to list shares of Dell Technologies (DVMT) on Wall Street again after taking the company private in 2013. Nonetheless, Gerber said that he understands why Musk wants to take Tesla private. So why does Musk still want to do this? Musk seems tired of dealing with skeptical Wall Street analysts and short sellers who are trying to profit from declines in the stock. One person on Twitter even mentioned Dell going private as a model for Tesla. A user named Evoto Rentals wrote "Been saying this all along. Just like Dell did. It saves a lot of headaches." Musk responded to that tweet with a simple, "Yes." If Tesla were private, short sellers would no longer have a way to make money from negative Tesla headlines. And Musk would not have to hold quarterly earnings calls and deal with questions from analysts that he finds tedious. Musk would have a lot more freedom to invest even more in solar roofs, the Tesla Semi truck and any other new products without having to incur the wrath of investors and analysts who question the strategy. Is $420 high enough of a price to take Tesla private? Perhaps not. Other Tesla bulls have said in the past they have no interest in selling anytime soon. Money manager Ron Baron told CNBC in May that "we're going to make 20 times our money because the opportunity is so enormous" for Tesla. Baron's firm -- Baron Capital -- owns nearly 1.7 million shares of Tesla, the 13th largest stake. Baron declined to comment to CNNMoney when asked specifically about Musk's proposal to take Tesla private. And Gerber said he personally would rather have Tesla remain public because he thinks the stock could go much higher than $420. But even he has a price at wihch he'd cash in. "If Musk wants to go private at $570, I would sell my stock," he said. "I would be happy and buy a new house."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170728204236-model-3-1-780x439.png
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/01/investing/vw-volkswagen-earnings-diesel-scandal/index.html?section=money_autos|VW says new emission tests pose major threat|Global trade tensions have put automakers under pressure. But Volkswagen says new emission tests in Europe pose the biggest threat to its business. "We cannot rest on our laurels because great challenges lie ahead of us in the coming quarters — especially regarding the transition to the new ... test procedure," CEO Herbert Diess said in a statement Wednesday. The tests presents a "titanic task" and "the biggest [sales] volume and earnings risk," the CEO said, according to a presentation prepared for reporters. Diess warned that factories could be closed temporarily, and some new models could be delayed. Volkswagen (VLKAF) isn't alone. Other automakers in Europe are struggling to prepare for the tests, which were introduced in late 2017. Industry groups have reported that testing bottlenecks are causing delays in certification. The new test, called the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), measures fuel consumption and emissions of CO2 and pollutants in conditions that simulate real-world driving scenarios. It's billed as a major improvement on the previous test, which was designed in the 1980s and failed to detect Volkswagen's rigging of its diesel emissions. The new tests are performed in independent labs and a single examination can take days to set up. Test facilities are running at 100% capacity and operating 24 hours a day, but that's not enough to avoid delays, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. "Neither manufacturers nor approval authorities have had sufficient time to prepare adequately," the association said in a statement. "The process of obtaining European Union approval has slowed down, resulting in planned [car] production being stopped or delayed." Related: What's next for Fiat Chrysler? All new car models sold across the 28 member states in the European Union must be certified by September. Even after regulators approve a model, vehicles can be randomly tested as they roll off the factory floor. Auto production is already suffering. The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported this week that domestic production of cars for the UK market dropped 47% in June. It said the new emission tests were contributing to the slowdown. Mike Hawes, CEO of the industry group, said the tests were one factor that had contributed to a "perfect storm" for automakers, which are also worried about the impact of Brexit. Volkswagen said Wednesday that it delivered 5.5 million cars in the first half of 2018, an increase of 7% over the previous year. Sales increased 3.5% to €119.4 billion ($139.5 billion) and operating profit rose nearly 10% to €9.8 billion ($11.5 billion). The company took a €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) charge related to the diesel scandal. Volkswagen warned that its financial performance could be volatile in the second half of the year because of the emission tests. Shares in the automaker dropped 3%.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180524113607-volkswagen-car-dealership-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/20/investing/funds-passive-active-etf/index.html?section=money_funds|Is this the end of investing as we know it?|An investing earthquake is underway and it's threatening to end traditional money management as we know it. Investors are pouring their money into so-called passive index funds that blindly track market indexes using computers. It's a shift that is coming at the expense of funds that are run by mere mortals, aka invesment managers, who try to pick stocks that will outperform the market. The trend is especially pronounced in the United States, where 28% of the industry's $17 trillion in assets are currently invested in passive funds, up from just 13% in 2008, according to data from market research firm Morningstar. American investors have plowed a total of $671 billion into passive funds since the start of 2015, while pulling $257 billion out of so-called active funds run by managers over the same period. Prominent BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink predicted this week that regulatory changes in the industry will encourage even more money to flow into these funds. "We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed," he said. "[Investors] will use [passive funds] more and more at the center of their portfolios." BlackRock's (BLK) popular iShares business, which offers investors passive exchange-traded funds (aka ETFs), saw $51 billion in net inflows over the past quarter while the firm's active funds brought in less than one-tenth that amount. While it's tempting to invest with top investment managers who promise to outperform the market, research has shown that this strategy often results in smaller returns. "Actively managed funds have generally underperformed their passive counterparts, especially over longer time horizons," said Morningstar researchers in a recent paper. The reason for the lackluster performance of active funds typically comes back to investment fees -- which are much higher at active funds. (Computer algorithms don't have kids to feed back at home!) Related: How should I invest a $250,000 windfall? But some market strategists warn that passive investing is becoming a crowded trade, with too many people hopping onto the bandwagon. "Indexing and ETFs offer tremendous value as part of the market, but they should not become the market. If this is an investor's singular approach to the markets, it represents a pursuit of mediocrity," said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161019112723-active-passive-etf-fund-investing-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/19/investing/stash-investing-app/index.html?section=money_funds|The investing app military families love|Wall Street banks prefer clients with millions -- if not billions -- to invest. Soldiers, nurses and construction workers typically aren't anywhere near that wealthy. That's why a growing number of average Joes are turning to an app called Stash instead. On Stash, you can start investing with just $5. The company's motto is "investing for real people." "Lots of our users start investing with less than $100. For us, that's great because they've taken that first step. They're learning," says Brandon Krieg, co-founder and CEO of Stash. Stash launched last fall. It already has over 150,000 users. About 10% of those are active-duty military, says Krieg. It's a high percentage considering less than half a percent of the U.S. population overall currently serves in the armed forces. "Stash is the solution for millions of Americans traditionally ignored or taken advantage of by big investing firms," says Krieg. "Almost all of our customers are first-time investors." Related: 10 best investing apps In addition to military personnel, the app is also popular with people who are self-employed, including Uber drivers. Stash makes investing incredibly simple. There are only 33 investment options, which is much easier than navigating the universe of thousands of stocks and funds. The app helps steer you in the right direction, but you still get to make the final decision. That's different than the so-called "roboadvisor" apps like Wealthfront and Betterment, where a computer decides how to invest your money. The co-founders of Stash wanted people to learn how to invest, not just hand over their money. "Financial literacy in this country is a huge problem," Krieg told CNNMoney. The Stash app is about to unveil a new feature called "learn" to help educate users even more. Related: My job nearly drove me to commit suicide To get going, the Stash app asks a few basic questions to determine if someone is comfortable with low, medium or high-risk investing. As you might expect, most people fall in the middle. Stash encourages most people to put at least some of their money into the "Moderate Mix" fund. Think of it like vanilla ice cream: A very solid option that still satisfies a person's desire to grow their money for retirement or sending a kid to college. Users can also choose from other funds like "Internet Titans," "Defending America," and "Clean & Green." These are stock funds, but the names have been translated from Wall Street jargon into normal people speak. Stash gets high marks from users for making investing easy and accessible, but pay attention to the fees. Stash charges $1 a month. That doesn't sound like a lot, but a user really needs to invest at least $250 or more for that level of fees to not eat up returns. Expect even more new features and growth from Stash this fall. This week the company announced $9.25 million in a Series A funding round led by Goodwater Capital.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160817124603-stash-investing-app-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/09/investing/bric-fund-goldman-sachs-emerging-markets/index.html?section=money_funds|BRIC investing is officially dead at Goldman Sachs|BRIC investing has officially fallen out of favor. Goldman Sachs (GS)' asset management business has killed off its BRIC fund, concluding that it would not "experience significant asset growth in the foreseeable future." The powerful investment bank was the original champion of investing in Brazil, Russia, India and China, which became known as BRIC nations. Goldman's former chairman Jim O'Neill coined the "BRIC" acronym in 2001 and brought the world's attention to strong growth potential in these large emerging markets. The acronym was later expanded to BRICS to include South Africa. However, the promise of BRIC countries has faded as Brazil's economy slumps, Russia struggles with low oil prices and international sanctions, and China's economy slows after previously posting double-digit growth figures. Goldman's BRIC fund was created in June 2006 and experienced wild swings during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. An official filing shows that it averaged a measly 3% average annual return and underperformed the MSCI BRIC index. Goldman warned in September that it planned to fold the BRIC fund into a more diversified emerging market fund on Oct. 23. Even though the BRIC era appears to be over, Goldman Sachs said it's not time to give up on all emerging markets. "Over the last decade emerging market investing has evolved from being tactical and opportunistic to being a strategic part of most asset allocations," said Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. "We continue to recommend that our clients have exposure to emerging markets across asset classes as part of their strategic asset allocation." An October report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies questioned whether the BRICS still matter, arguing that "the foundation of the BRICS concept is beginning to crumble." "Conflicting interests and the indisputable political, social, and cultural differences among the group's members have kept the BRICS from translating their economic force into collective political power on the global stage," the report said. "And with economic prospects decreasingly promising, the notion of the BRICS as a political project seems too fragile to stand on its own."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151109085611-rip-bric-780x439.jpg

Time for more short sellers|Harvard University is concerned about "frothy" markets. So it's looking to hire short sellers -- investors who bet that a stock will fall. The head of Harvard's massive endowment -- worth nearly $38 billion -- warned that current market conditions "present various challenges to investors." "This environment is likely to result in lower future returns than in the recent past," wrote Stephen Blyth, who took over as Harvard's chief investment officer in January, in a letter this week. In his note, Blyth said he's looking for managers with expertise in short selling to cope with a market that's "potentially frothy." He's also worried about liquidity, pointing to the dramatic drop in U.S. Treasuries on October 15, 2014 as "a stark manifestation of the evaporation of liquidity." He said that liquidity can vanish from the market even "when no material economic event has occurred." Related: Cause of Flash Crash is a mystery The performance of Harvard's endowment has been disappointing in recent years. Its returns have lagged behind Ivy League peers like Yale and Columbia. Harvard's endowment grew by 5.8% in fiscal year 2015, which ended in June, but Blyth noted that's unlikely to vault Harvard back to the top. Real estate and venture capital were Harvard's top performing assets last year. Blyth said the endowment team will continue to look for opportunities in life sciences, laboratory space and the retail sector. Harvard's frothy markets comment comes on the heels of other prominent financial leaders' warnings. Germany's finance minister has gone as far as to use the word "bubble" about current market conditions.

Its star has dramatically dimmed after its founder, the "bond king" Bill Gross, left Pimco almost a year ago. Investors started taking out billions of dollars from Pimco after Gross left and continue to do so. Just in August, they pulled $1.8 billion out of Pimco's Total Return fund, Gross' former signature fund. Today it has less than $100 billion in total assets, the lowest level since 2007, according to the company. At its height in 2013, the fund managed $293 billion. In May, Vanguard surpassed Pimco as the world's largest bond fund manager. Pimco's fall from grace is a lesson in what happens when a firm's fortunes are so closely linked to one person's identity. Gross was synonymous with the Pimco name and it's no surprise that the firm's fortunes have suffered after his departure. Related: Wall Street bombshell: Bill Gross out at Pimco Gross allegedly left after clashing with other execs over how to manage the company. Gross had developed a reputation of being a little strange towards the end of his tenure. He once wrote an ode to his dead cat named Bob in an investment outlook note to clients. He left Pimco last September to work at Janus Capital Group (JNS). The fund had been losing money before Gross left, but his departure appears to have led to an exodus of funds.

Mom and pop investors are dumping their investments and moving to cash at levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008. It's an "investor revolt," is how Credit Suisse characterized it. Normally when investors panic about stocks falling, they sell stocks and buy bonds, which are viewed as safer. But that's not happening now. Investors aren't just fleeing stocks, they're exiting bonds, commodities and international funds too. July and August will be the first two-month stretch that retail investors have pulled money from BOTH stock and bond funds since the end of 2008, according to Credit Suisse. The wild swings in stocks in the past week have only exacerbated the selling. This week alone, investors have pulled nearly $30 billion from stock funds.

As they save lives, biotech companies are simultaneously making a lot of money for investors. That's why the hottest ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on the planet since the bull market began in March 2009 invest in biotech companies. The First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) has skyrocketed more than 500% over that timeframe. That trounces the S&P 500's 200% gain. The fund outperformed by owning a bunch of the sexiest names in the biotech industry, including Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Novavax (NVAX). ETFs specialize in giving investors diversified exposure to a specific corner of the market, like biotech. These pooled vehicles invest in numerous stocks, bonds and commodities -- not just one. That's especially helpful when investors want exposure to a volatile sector like biotech, which experiences turbulence tied to the risks involved with getting drugs approved by the government. As an added bonus, ETFs are cheap. Or at least cheaper than most mutual funds. That's partially because most ETFs are index funds, meaning they track a basket of assets that's already been created by highly-paid professionals. Other biotech related- ETFs are also generating spectacular returns, including the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) and the PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF (PJP). The latter ETF combines biotech stocks with more traditional pharmaceutical players like Eli Lilly (LLY) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Another big winner is the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH), which owns biotech names like Botox maker Allergan (AGN) and Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP).|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150203112755-biotech-etfs-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/04/retirement/millennial-retirement-savings/index.html?section=money_funds|Millennials may not be able to afford retirement essentials|While many Americans are falling short on savings, millennials are most at risk of being unable to afford essential retirement expenses -- such as food, shelter and medical care, according to a Fidelity Investments survey released Wednesday. Fidelity found that about 55% of people surveyed are at risk of being unable to cover these expenses. Typical baby boomers (born 1946 to 1964) are on track to reach 81% of their retirement income needs, according to the survey. Generation X-ers (born 1965 to 1977) are expected to reach only 71%, and Generation Y or millennials (born 1978-1988) have the largest projected income gap at 62%. The retirement provider asked over 2,000 Americans a range of questions, from their health to retirement saving habits. It analyzed a variety of factors, including current income, savings rates, home equity and projected Social Security and pension benefits to predict how much money people will need in retirement and whether they are on track to meet that goal. Related: How to be a 401(k) millionaire Across generations, many people simply aren't saving enough, Fidelity found, with 40% of those surveyed saving less than 6% of their salaries -- far below the 10 to 15% recommended by financial planners. For millennials, that percentage jumps to 51%. Also driving the disparity: Boomers are more likely to have some sort of pension benefit and plan to work longer, according to John Sweeney, Fidelity's executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies. Boomers had a median desired retirement age of 66, whereas millennials wanted to retire two years earlier than that. Yet today's young people could live well into their 90s and will have to wait until they are 67 in order to claim full Social Security benefits. "Some of the older folks had more realistic expectations," he said. Many young people are also playing it too safe with investments, he said. Of millennials surveyed, 50% said they had less than half of their investments in stocks. In contrast, common rules of thumb recommend that 30-year-olds should have up to 90% of their portfolio in stocks since they have decades of savings ahead of them. Related: Will you have enough to retire? It's not all bad news though. Sweeney noted that while they have the farthest to go, millennials also have the most time to catch up.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/24/retirement/pension-overpayments/index.html?section=money_funds|Pensions ask retirees to pay back tens of thousands|Some pension plans have overpaid retirees for years -- now they're demanding their money back. For retirees, it can mean owing tens of thousands of dollars. And with little warning, their pension checks are being slashed to cover their debt. In April 2011, New Jersey resident Carol Montague received a letter from American Water Works Co.'s pension plan saying it had overpaid her for more than five years and wanted its money back -- plus interest. Montague, now 67, was told she owed roughly $45,000. Two weeks later, Montague's pension benefits dropped from $1,246 to around $325 a month, or half what she should have been paid all along. The plan takes out roughly $300 a month in order to pay itself back. Once Montague's health care premium is deducted, her monthly pension check shrinks to less than $25. She gets another $1,200 a month from Social Security, but it's not enough. So, in addition to her part-time job as a school crossing guard, she is working as a salesperson at Macy's. So far, Montague has repaid almost $9,000 -- calculations show that she won't repay her debt in full until 2024. Share your story: Are you worried about your pension? American Water said Montague signed a document verifying the correct pension amount and that they are legally allowed to collect any overpayment, with interest, to protect the viability of the pension fund. Montague acknowledges she made a mistake, but didn't think she needed to confirm that her benefits matched the amount in the letter she had signed almost a year before she retired. "I put it away in a steel box. I never looked at it again. It was stupid on my part," she said. "But it took (almost) six years for them to find out they overpaid me?" With the help of the Mid-Atlantic Pension Counseling Project, a government-sponsored program, she has appealed to the pension plan to waive the interest, as well as ease some of the overpayment burden. But the plan has refused. As pensions face increased financial scrutiny -- and shrinking funds -- pension counseling programs are seeing even more cases like Montague's. This year, nearly 600 retired metal workers and their spouses are facing these so-called recoupment demands from the Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 73 Pension Fund, based outside of Chicago. Related: Will your congressman retire richer than you? In a letter sent to the pension recipients in May, the fund said a 2010 audit found that certain pensions were calculated incorrectly from 1974 to 2004, resulting in more than $5 million in overpayments, according to an IRS filing. The fund is now demanding that the retirees pay back decades worth of mistakes, including interest based on the plan's rates of return. In July, the pension fund reduced hundreds of checks to the proper payment amount and then again, to make up for the overpayments, often by as much as 25%. Since the pension fund is forecasting that many of the retirees will die before their debts are repaid, it is asking many of them to make large upfront payments. It's unclear why the pension fund, which did not respond to requests for comment, waited several years to make the adjustments. Carole Grant, 75, was told by the sheet metal worker's plan that she owed almost $61,000 (roughly half of which was interest) for nearly 20 years of overpayments on the spousal benefits she received from her deceased husband's pension. Her monthly benefit of $394 should have actually been $249, the pension fund said. Related: Are you saving enough for retirement? As a result, she's been asked to make an upfront payment of $54,000 and her check has been reduced to $187 a month. While she has other sources of income, she doesn't think she should have to turn over her retirement savings. "I don't feel that I should be penalized for the mistakes that they made," she said. Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group, said that, in most cases, retirees have no idea they are being overpaid since "the way a benefit is figured in a typical pension plan is impossible for an ordinary person to fathom." She called the sheet metal workers case the "most egregious" she's seen, underscoring the need for federal regulations, such as imposing a statute of limitations and limiting how dramatically a pension check can be reduced. She also said many retirees don't realize that plans rarely take legal actions to recover the lump sums. Money 101: Planning for retirement While some of the retired sheet metal workers have been able to get their debts forgiven or reduced by filing "hardship waivers," many have had appeals denied, said Tim Kelly, an attorney representing some of the retirees. One of his clients, 63-year-old Ed Cochran, has received a disability pension since 1995 and was told he owes the fund nearly $100,000, $42,464 of which is interest. His monthly checks had included an excess $262 a month. Cochran paid years' worth of income taxes and child support based on the amounts he received. And he's heard of many retirees in worse financial shape than him. "There are so many other older retirees who didn't plan for rainy days," Cochran said. "This is all they have."

http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/23/retirement/middle-class-retirement/index.html?section=money_funds|Many middle-class Americans plan to work until they die|A growing percentage of middle-class Americans say they have saved so little for retirement that they expect to work into their 80s or even until they either get too sick or die, according to a recent survey. Nearly half of middle-class workers said they are not confident that they will be able to save enough to retire comfortably, according to a Wells Fargo survey of 1,000 workers between the ages of 25 and 75, with household incomes between $25,000 and $100,000. As a result, 34% said they plan to work until they're at least 80 -- that's up from 25% in 2011 and 30% last year. An even larger percentage, 37%, said they'll never retire and plan to either work until they get too sick or die, the survey found. Driving these concerns is that many of the respondents said they simply can't afford to pay their monthly bills and save for retirement at the same time. Money 101: Planning for retirement "For the past three years, the struggle to pay bills is a growing concern and the prospect of saving for retirement looks dim, particularly for those in their prime saving years," Laurie Nordquist, head of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, said in a statement. The concerns come as many middle-class families are trying to make do with less. The country's median annual household income is down by more than 8% since 2007. And many of the jobs lost during the recent recession have been replaced with lower wage positions. With minimal savings built up, a third of those surveyed said Social Security will be their primary source of income during retirement. Of those making less than $50,000, nearly half said they will rely mainly on Social Security. In August, the average Social Security recipient received around $15,000 a year in retirement benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. Related: Don't let the government's drama derail your 401(k) Another factor holding back middle-class savers is a fear of investing in the stock market, said Nordquist. Across workers of all ages, only 24% said they were confident in the stock market as a place to invest for retirement. And slightly more than half said they don't invest in the stocks because they are afraid to lose their savings in the ups and downs of the market. This is despite the fact that financial planners say that investing in stocks is the best way to grow a nest egg that will be large enough to cover decades of retirement. Over years of savings, short-term losses are overtaken by the long-term gains that years of compounded returns offer. "There is a striking amount of fear about the stock market among all investors," she said. "The middle class just isn't making the link between being invested and the potential growth of their savings.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/131023114448-middle-class-retirement-1024x576.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/19/pf/college/california-online-community-college/index.html?section=money_pf_college|California is creating one big online community college|There's going to be a new way for workers to advance their careers in California. Lawmakers included $100 million in this year's state budget to create an online community college that will offer certificate and credentialing programs. It will get another $20 million annually. The plan was proposed by Governor Jerry Brown and backed by California Community Colleges Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley. The mission is to retrain workers with skills needed in high-demand jobs. There are 2.5 million Californians between the ages of 25 and 34 who are in the workforce but never completed a college degree. "We're targeting what we call 'stranded workers.' They are in jobs that will eventually be eliminated because of automation and/or they have no real opportunity for economic mobility because all new jobs require some kind of post-secondary credential," Oakley told CNN. Roughly one-third of new jobs in the state are expected to require some career technical education that goes beyond high school but not as far as a four-year degree, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Related: A degree from this college all but guarantees you a job The statewide online community college will be tailored to working adults and prepare workers for jobs in growing industries, like advanced manufacturing, healthcare, the service sector, in-home support services, and child development. The programs are intended to be different than what's already offered by the state's community college system. They will usually be shorter than a two-year associate's degree program. Some will take just three or four weeks, Oakley said. But many faculty members oppose the creation of a new online school. They say the money would be better spent expanding existing online options. "Rather than beginning a whole new college and wasting millions of dollars developing a new bureaucracy, the proposed allocation of $120 million would be much better spent expanding the existing community college Online Education Initiative," a group of independent faculty unions wrote in a letter opposing the measure. Related: Walmart wants to pay for its workers to go to college Credentials in information technology support and medical coding will be the first offered at the new online school. "We're predicting 10,000 job openings in medical coding over the next four or five years. We will continue to offer it until we see that employer demand was waned," Oakley said. A credential in medical coding is not currently offered by California's community college system, which is one of the biggest in the country and has 114 campuses. The cost will be comparable to the $46 per credit charged by the traditional community colleges. But students may be charged on a per-module or subscription system, Oakley said. The plan is to begin enrolling students in the new online college by the end of 2019. The state budget was approved by lawmakers on Thursday. The governor has until June 30 to sign the legislation.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171016131117-california-free-community-college-780x439.jpg

Employees can choose from seven business or computer science-related bachelor's degrees selected at three universities. Discover will cover the cost of tuition, fees and books and supplies needed to complete the program for however long it takes. About 99% of Discover's 16,500 workers will qualify, including full-time employees and part-time workers who work at least 30 hours a week, the company said. The motivation behind the new benefit is two-fold, said Jon Kaplan, vice president of training and development at Discover. One reason is to help the company recruit and retain good workers in a tight labor market. The other is to "do the right thing" by helping prepare workers for a wide range of career opportunities inside or out of the company. "Investing in our employees and their futures will not only make us a stronger company, but have a lasting positive impact on those who might otherwise never get the chance to attend college," Kaplan said. Related: Walmart workers can go to college for $1 a day As competition for good employees heats up, several companies are boosting their tuition benefits. Walmart, McDonald's, Taco Bell, and several hotel companies have expanded their education benefits all within the past six months. A little more than half of companies subsidized a college degree for workers in 2017, according to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management. Many offer up to $5,250 a year because anything more is taxed as income. But Discover, which is offering to pay the full cost of the degree, will pay the tax for the worker if their annual award exceeds that amount, Kaplan said. An existing tuition assistance benefit at Discover covers up to $5,250 a year for a degree from any accredited college.

It's not your fault. Many of them are missing important information, use jargon or acronyms, and don't differentiate between scholarships and loans, according to a new report from think tank NewAmerica and uAspire, a nonprofit that advises students on the financial aid process. The report, which looked at letters from 900 schools, showed 36% of award letters didn't state how much a student will actually have to pay. Financial aid letters are usually sent to students in the spring to tell them what scholarships and grants they'll receive for the upcoming school year. But the confusion makes it difficult for families to financially prepare when they may have to choose a college before seeing a final bill. "Students and families confront a detrimental lack of information and transparency when making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives: paying for college," the researchers wrote. Related: How much should you pay for college? Since there's no national standard, it's hard to compare offers from different schools. When costs were calculated, the report found that 23 different formulas were used. For example, one college may include loans (money you have to pay back) in the calculation while another may not. And schools may or may not factor in things like housing, meals and books. What might appear to be the cheaper school may actually end up costing more money. To get a clearer picture of your options, try calculating the cost on your own. This online calculator designed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might help. Here are some terms you need to know before you start. Pell Grant A Pell Grant is federal money awarded to some low-income students, based on family income and other information listed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Pell Grants — and grants in general — do not need to be repaid. But you might not get the same award the following year. States and colleges may also offer separate grants to students. Related: Will saving for college reduce your financial aid? Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) The SEOG is another type of grant awarded by the federal government to students from low-income families. Like a Pell Grant, you do not have to pay back the SEOG, and you must submit the FAFSA form to be eligible. Federal Work-Study If work-study money is listed in the financial aid award, a student can get a part-time job on campus and be paid up to the amount awarded. You don't have to pay this money back, but you do have to find the job and work enough hours to be paid the full amount. Related: Women hold two-thirds of all student debt Direct Unsubsidized Loan This is a loan from the federal government. Usually, you must start repaying it six months after leaving school. (If it's unsubsidized, interest will start accruing immediately. If it's subsidized, the government will pay the interest accrued while you were in school.) The report found 136 different variations of the name of a Direct Loan were used among letters from 455 colleges that included them. And 24 of the variations did not use the word "loan." They are also known as William D. Ford Direct Loans. Parent PLUS Loan PLUS loans are also federal loans, but they are taken out in a parent's name. While a financial aid letter may include them in the package, parents must apply for them separately and could be denied if they have an adverse credit history. Expected Family Contribution If this is listed in your letter, it is usually calculated by the college using information from the FAFSA. It's the amount the college expects your family to be able to pay for the upcoming year. But it may not be what you actually owe, depending on whether the college offers enough aid to fill in the gap. You could end up owing more — or less.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180607113458-financial-aid-letter-780x439.jpg

Women hold most of it|About four in ten people who've gone to college have taken out loans to pay for school. But some people are taking on a lot more debt than others. Women hold nearly two-thirds of all student debt in the US, according to a report from the American Association of University Women, a group that advocates for equity and education for women and girls. Part of the reason is that more women go to college. They represented 56% of students enrolled in the fall of 2016. But that doesn't explain the whole gender gap. More women take out loans, and when they do, they borrow more money. The average woman owes $2,740 more than a man upon finishing a bachelor's degree, the report said. Women are also repaying their debt more slowly, which can mean they're paying more in interest over time. Related: Does saving for college mean you'll get less financial aid? Here are some other surprising stats about student loans. Americans owe $1.5 trillion in student loans We hit this milestone during the first quarter of 2018, according to Federal Reserve data.

It does not include those who went to a for-profit college. 20% of borrowers are behind on payments Those who never finished their degrees are more likely to have trouble keeping up with their payments, the Federal Reserve report said.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/31/pf/college/save-for-college-financial-aid/index.html?section=money_pf_college|How your savings affect college financial aid|True or false? The richer you are, the less you'll receive in financial aid. The statement is generally true. But if you know the rules of the game, saving for your child's education won't significantly reduce their financial aid award. The reason is that income is the major deciding factor in whether you need financial aid. Savings and other assets are factored into what you can afford to pay, but only a little. "Assets don't impact the bottom line all that much," said Kal Chany, the author of Paying For College Without Going Broke. For every dollar you save, you might — at most — lose 5.6 cents in financial aid. "You will be much happier if you have saved for college," Chany said. But some saving strategies are better than others. Here's what you need to know. Don't save money in your child's name Assets in the child's name — including a savings account, trust fund, or brokerage account — will count more heavily against the financial aid award than assets in a parent's name. Money saved in an account owned by the child could cost you four times as much in financial aid as money in an account owned by a parent. Using a 529 college savings account A 529 college savings account is useful because it can lower your tax bill. The earnings on money invested are not taxed as long as the funds are used for tuition, fees, books, or room and board. To play it safe, make sure a parent is the owner of the account. The child can be named the beneficiary, and the money will still be considered a parental asset. But be careful using money from a 529 account owned by a grandparent or other relative. While it won't count at all as an asset, it could hurt your aid formula two years after you withdraw money to pay your tuition bill. At that point, it will be considered income. Related: How much is too much to pay for college? Minimize your income Parents' income is the biggest factor in the financial aid calculation. "$10,000 in extra income has a much bigger impact on financial aid than $10,000 in assets," Chany said. While you don't want to ask your boss for a pay cut, there are some things you can do to reduce your income. For example, avoiding large capital gains or withdrawals from a retirement account. If you're due a large bonus at work, ask if you can defer receiving it. The federal financial aid formula is based, in part, on your income two calendar years before the start of the school year. So, it helps to maximize your income before January 1 of your child's sophomore year of high school, or defer extra income until after January 1 of their sophomore year of college. Related: Why your financial aid award is less than expected Loans might be part of your financial aid award Financial aid formulas intend to calculate how much a family can afford to pay. This is called the Expected Family Contribution. More income and assets will result in a bigger EFC. Financial aid is meant to fill in the gap between the EFC and the college's price tag. Some colleges say they will make sure the remaining cost is met, but others don't make that promise. Many public schools won't do it for out-of-state students. Even if the institution pledges to meet a family's full need, the aid award could include loans — which will have to be paid back by the student.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201165936-student-loan-forgiveness-780x439.jpg

Meanwhile, others will pay next to nothing. Most people will fall somewhere in between. But how much is too much? CNN asked six experts to weigh in, including the head of a public university, financial aid officers, and student loan lenders. Related: 7 ways to pay for college The answer depends on personal circumstances like your family's finances and values. It also depends on where you live and what you'll study. "It seems like something that should have a set cost, but it's a complicated question," said Carol Folt, the Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Here are a few tips to help you figure out your number: Don't borrow more than $50,000 The experts agreed that rather than worrying about the total price tag, you should focus on how much debt you'll take on, and your ability to pay it back. "Debt is what can burden you going forward and can limit your life choices," Folt said. An oft-cited rule of thumb is to borrow no more than what you'll earn the first year after graduation. But in order to figure that out, you'll need to know how much you'll be earning. That can be tough to pin down. One recent survey found that the average starting salary for an entry-level position for someone with a bachelor's degree this year is $50,000.

But those who pursue a more volatile career or go on to graduate school may want to borrow less money, said Kal Chany, the author of Paying for College Without Going Broke. To get a better sense of what different majors may pay, check out this data from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce on lifetime earnings. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data on lifetime earnings by career. A third source, the government's College Scorecard, shows the median earnings of graduates by school, 10 years after entering college. (It only considers students who received federal financial aid.) Experts told CNN that earnings stats can be "opaque," "quite misleading," and should be taken "with a grain of salt." But it can at least give you a good starting point on figuring out what kind of earning potential you can expect with your degree, and get you started on running some numbers. "It doesn't have to be an exact thing. It still helps to think about these ideas," Chany said. Borrowing $31,000 is 'safe' If you have no idea what you'll major in or what kind of job you'll pursue, here's one way to think about you're borrowing limit: The government allows dependent students pursuing a bachelor's degree to borrow up to $31,000 in federal loans. "If that's what the government allows, there's reason to believe that's a safe amount," said Kathy Ruby, a college finance consultant at College Coach and former financial aid officer at St. Olaf College and Shippensburg University. Any additional borrowing will likely have to be in a parent's name. They'll want to think about how much they have saved for retirement, whether their home is paid off, and how many other children are going to college when taking out debt, Chany said. $10,000 of debt will cost you $100 a month It's important to understand how much your debt will cost you. You'll be paying back more than what your borrow because of interest. Interest rates on federal loans change each year. (Last year, the interest rate on undergraduate loans was 4.45%.) But here's a rough estimate from Joe DePaulo, CEO of lender College Ave Student Loans. For every $10,000 you borrow in federal loans, you'll owe about $100 a month for 10 years. So if you borrow $30,000, you're looking at a monthly student loan payment of $300, give or take. In this case, the first $300 of your monthly take-home pay will be gone before you can pay for anything else. Related: The best ways to borrow money for college, if you have to This monthly payment could be lower since there are several different loan repayment plans. But paying less in the beginning means you'll be paying more later on. Here's another rule of thumb from Angela Galardi Ceresnie, the COO of student lender Climb Credit: Your monthly loan payment should be no more than 10% of your monthly take-home pay. Should you go to college at all? People with a college degree earn more over the course of their career than those without one. But if you start and don't finish college, some of the earnings bump will likely be lost. Less than half of the people who go to college actually should, said Bryan Caplan, an economist and author of The Case Against Education. The rest either choose a low-paying major or don't finish their degree, so it's not worth their time and money, he said. "If you just think of education like any other investment, the success rate is crucial," Caplan said. If you didn't do well in high school and scored low on the SATs, it might mean you shouldn't pay anything for a four-year degree.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180510161237-paying-for-college-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/08/news/economy/millenial-generation-uk-money-inequality/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Should Millennials get $13,500 to close the generation gap?|Should young people in the United Kingdom be given £10,000 ($13,500) when they turn 25? A top think tank says yes. The proposal from the Resolution Foundation is one of a number of suggestions for reducing inequality between the young and old. British Millennials and their peers in other developed countries have fallen behind older generations when it comes to wealth, income and home ownership, a trend that politicians have been slow to address in the wake of the global financial crisis. "We need not just some tinkering, but some big and dramatic solutions," said Matt Whittaker, deputy director at the Resolution Foundation. The £10,000 payment would come with strings attached: Young people would only be allowed to spend it on developing new skills, entrepreneurship, housing or pensions. The payments would cost an estimated £7 billion ($9.5 billion) per year and would be financed by an overhaul of the inheritance tax system. The researchers suggested dozens of other changes to improve UK housing, education, health care and the employment market in a bid to give young people a boost. They would control rent levels, improve apprenticeship programs and dramatically lower taxes on home purchases. "We built it as a package. The idea is that doing one of these without the other would be good, but not as good," said Whittaker. Brits born during the 1980s and 1990s have faced tough economic challenges since the Great Recession, including an unusual slowdown in wage growth and higher housing costs. Resolution Foundation research shows that Brits have typically earned more than generations that came before. But the trend stopped with Millennials, who are earning less than Generation X — those born between 1966 and 1980. "This stalling of generational pay progress is unprecedented," the researchers said. Britain's vote to leave the European Union, which caused inflation to spike, won't help matters. The Resolution Foundation said that when inflation is taken into account, it will take nearly two decades for pay to return to its peak from before the recession. Related: Kate and William can afford 3 kids. Many Brits cannot But would the changes, including the extra £10,000, be enough? Kay Neufeld, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said the payment would be "a massive leg up." "I think it would change a lot for a lot of people," he said, adding that it could make home ownership feel within reach, or encourage someone to go to university. A spokesperson for the government said it welcomed the report from the Resolution Foundation, and described the gap between generations as "one of the key challenges of our time." The spokesperson declined to say whether proposals in the report would be considered. Tom Selby, an analyst at stockbroker AJ Bell, said that politicians wouldn't be attracted to the suggestions because they might hurt seniors. "Many of the ideas aren't new and face the same barrier as other reforms -- namely the reality of politics," he said. Fix the economy first Still, the policy suggestions would not address other structural problems in the UK economy, including slow productivity. "If we could fix the productivity problem then it would make a lot of the problems that we highlight easier to deal with," said Whittaker. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said the ultimate goal should be a more productive economy. "The future lies in stronger growth and making sure that young workers are equipped to be more productive, and hopefully earnings will rise," she said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180110191829-salary-quit-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/21/news/economy/daca-students-arizona-tuition/index.html?section=money_pf_college|DACA students fear tuition ruling will force them to drop out of college|Gilbert Olmos should be excited that he's wrapping up his freshman year at South Mountain Community College and getting one step closer to his dream of becoming a registered nurse. But instead he's terrified his college education -- and his dream -- will come to an abrupt end. Earlier this month, Arizona's Supreme Court ruled that students who have gained legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program can no longer receive breaks on tuition from the state's colleges and universities. This means costs could almost triple for thousands of DACA status students in Arizona. DACA has enabled nearly 689,000 young immigrants who were brought into the country as children to come out from the shadows and openly attend school and obtain work permits and driver's licenses without the fear of being deported. With his DACA status, Olmos qualified for in-state tuition. But just days after the ruling, he received an email from his school saying his tuition rate might change. In-state tuition is $86 per credit hour at Maricopa Community Colleges. Out-of-state it's $327 per credit hour. For Olmos, this means his cost per semester will jump from a little more than $1,000 a semester to the out-of-state rate of more than $5,000. "I fell apart as soon as I heard it," said Olmos, 19, who is pursing an associate's degree in applied science at South Mountain in Phoenix. Related: Despite DACA uncertainty, Dreamers still determined to go to college He was planning to get his associate's degree, then transfer to University of Arizona for his bachelor's before heading to nursing school. "I'm a hard working student. I've been working retail jobs to pay my tuition myself," said Olmos, whose parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was a year-and-a-half old. "Realistically, with the new rates I might not be able to afford college." If he does have to drop out, Olmos has a temporary backup plan. He's a certified phlebotomist, trained at drawing blood from patients. Olmos took the six-month course after graduating from high school. "I would probably have to do this full-time until I figure things out with my education," he said. There are currently 2,000 DACA status students enrolled in the Maricopa Community Colleges network, which includes 10 colleges in the Phoenix area. "Right now we are telling them their tuition might be impacted, but we're not sure yet when it will go into effect," said Matthew Hasson, a spokesman for Maricopa Community Colleges. He acknowledged the higher tuition rates could force students to drop out completely. "These are wonderful people and some of our best and most hard working students," said Hasson. "We are working tirelessly to find some way to help them because we don't want them to leave. At the same time, we know we have to comply with the court ruling." My dream has been 'jerked out of my hands' Dreamers don't have permanent legal status, or a path to citizenship, so they aren't eligible for federal student aid either. Therefore, they must pay for college either on their own, through private donors or rely on scholarships. That's how Ana Ascencio, 18, paid for her freshman year at Maricopa's GateWay Community College, where she's a political science major. She received a full scholarship from TheDream.US, a nationwide scholarship fund that helps DACA status immigrants attend one of 75 colleges in 15 states. But now even her scholarship is in jeopardy. One stipulation of TheDream.US's scholarships is that the student be eligible for in-state tuition rates at one of its partner schools. Ascencio, who came to the US when she was four from Mexico and grew up in Arizona, was eligible for in-state tuition and the scholarship last year. But now she -- like the 150 other TheDream.US scholarship recipients in Arizona -- doesn't know if she'll be eligible for either. "We are currently working with Maricopa County Community Colleges and Arizona State University to find an affordable path forward for our Arizona scholars to support them in completing [their] college degrees," said Candy Marshall, president of TheDream.US. Ascencio wants to go to law school and become an immigration attorney, but everything seems uncertain. "This court ruling is so surreal. My heart sank and I cried so much when I heard the news," she said. "My whole college education dream has been jerked out of my hands." Related: Who is covered by DACA? Teachers, caregivers and more Vasthy Lamadrid feels the same way. She is a senior at Arizona State University and is majoring in political science and pursuing a teaching certificate. She has lined up a job that begins in the fall that counts toward her certification. "I'm scared," she said. "If my tuition rates jumps and I can't pay the out-of-state rate, I can't continue with my teaching certification program in the fall." Currently, the in-state tuition rate for undergraduates at the school is $10,792. Out-of-state students pay more than double that at $27,372. Lamadrid said school administrators have said they want to help DACA students but she's aware that the school also has to comply with the ruling. She attended a meeting late Thursday with students and faculty where DACA students were told they should expect the new tuition rates to begin this summer. Arizona State University did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Lamadrid said she knows many other DACA students at Arizona State who have plans for postgraduate and other advanced degrees. "This ruling will put a halt to these goals," she said. "Some have already been accepted into those programs. Now they don't know what to do."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180419095401-ana-karen-2-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/pf/student-loan-repayment-plans/index.html?section=money_pf_college|When student loan forgiveness plans might not be worth it|I have made five years of income-based student loan payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan during my residency and fellowship. But now I owe close to $450,000 even though I only borrowed $320,000. I would like to continue paying under this plan, but the interest would explode. I am starting a new job at a non-profit hospital with a $356,000 salary. What do I do? — Anonymous Choosing the best student loan repayment plan can feel like gambling with your future. Those with big debts, especially doctors and lawyers, may be tempted to lower their payments by enrolling in one of the government's income-driven plans. Not only does this offer immediate relief, but some plans will forgiven any remaining debt after at least 20 years. But there's a catch. It's possible you'll pay more over the life of the loan because your payments will be spread out over a longer period of time and you'll be paying more interest. "Sometimes we see borrowers so focused on the fact that they could get forgiveness, they don't realize they may still end up paying back more," said Betsy Mayotte, the president and founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. The overall goal is to pay the least amount over time, she said. How much you end up paying overall can depend on some unknowns, like your future income, future job, and how many children you might have one day. It can get confusing because there's not just one income-driven plan. If you have federal loans, there are seven different variations. Plus, some people who work in public service will get their debt wiped away after 10 years of payments. Ask yourself these three questions before deciding what student loan repayment plan to select Are you struggling to make your payments? If you're in a low-paying job, you might have to lower your payments in order to be able to make them. Depending on your income, your monthly payment could be as low as $0 on some plans. That may sound great while you're struggling financially, but you might not be paying enough to cover the interest. That means your balance will keep getting bigger. Income-driven plans can make sense if you have either a lot of debt, a low income, several children — or some combination. Many are based on your discretionary income, which considers your pay, your family size, and the state you live in. Related: Is anyone actually getting public service loan forgiveness? Will you make a lot more money in the future? On many plans, your monthly payment will be a percentage of your income. So even though your payments may seem low at first, you'll owe more as your income goes up. Mayotte suggests using the government's online repayment estimator at least once a year, or whenever you get a raise, get married, or have a child. (If you're married and filing jointly, your spouse's income will be considered when your monthly payment is calculated.) It should tell you how much your monthly payments would be, the total amount you'll pay back over the lifetime of the loan, how long it will take, and if you'll be eligible for any debt forgiveness. This can help you figure out if it's worth increasing your payments. Remember, the longer it takes you to pay off, the more interest you end up paying. Related: Should he pay off his student debt faster or invest? How long will it take you to pay off your debt? If you're hoping to receive loan forgiveness, use the estimator to crunch your own numbers first. There is a chance that you might be finished paying off your debt before you're due any forgiveness. You must pay for at least 20 years on an income-driven plan before you'll receive forgiveness. If you have loans for graduate school, you'll have to pay for 25 years. There's another thing to consider. The forgiven debt will be taxed if you live in a state with income tax — unless you receive forgiveness from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/06/pf/student-loan-interest-tax-deduction/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Got student loans? Don't make this major tax mistake|If you've been paying off student loans, don't make the mistake of filing your taxes without getting a deduction on the interest you've paid on your loans. "If you're paying 4% [interest] on your loans and not getting the deduction," says Michael Chen a CPA and founder of Henry.tax, "it is expensive and you're not getting the full benefit." Who is eligible for the deduction and how do you claim a loan interest deduction? Am I eligible? Anyone paying student loans may be able to deduct up to $2,500 of the interest paid in the past year on a qualified student loan, according to the IRS. And that deduction will be claimed as an adjustment to your income. The deduction is available to anyone earning less than $80,000 (or $165,000 if you file a joint return), but it's gradually phased out if your modified adjusted gross income is between $65,000 and $80,000. To find out if you can claim the deduction you can use this IRS Tool. You'll need to know your filing stats, income, adjusted gross income and any expenses you've paid for education loans. The deduction can reduce the amount of your taxable income by up to $2,500. There are some other qualifications, too. The loan has to have been for a student enrolled, at least half time, in a program leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential. If you took out a loan from a relative or through an employer plan, you're out of luck. How do I file? You'll want to talk this through with your parents if they've recently claimed you as a dependent or plan to. If you are obligated to pay the loan and they claim you as a dependent, neither you or they will be able to claim the loan interest deduction. But, here's an upside: If you're obligated to make the interest payments and someone else pays for you — your parents, maybe — the IRS's view is that you're receiving the payments from the other person and, in turn, paying the interest. Consequently, you get to take the deduction. Any borrower who pays more than $600 in interest should receive a Form 1098-E — a student loan interest statement from the lender. On your 1040 form you'll enter the amount of loan interest you've paid, up to $2,500. The student loan interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income, which means you can still claim it even if you don't itemize deductions.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201165936-student-loan-forgiveness-780x439.jpg

The company said it will allocate $150 million over five years to expand its existing tuition assistance benefit, an investment "accelerated by changes in the US tax law." Starting May 1, eligible restaurant employees can receive $2,500 a year, up from $700 previously, and managers can receive $3,000 a year, up from $1,050. The benefit is retroactive to January 1. McDonald's is also loosening the eligibility requirements. Employees will now qualify after 90 days of employment, instead of nine months, and will need to work a minimum of 15 hours a week, down from 20 hours. Almost 400,000 workers are expected to be eligible for the program, nearly double the number previously, a spokesperson said. 16,400 employees were awarded tuition assistance under the more limited eligibility requirements since it launched in April 2015, according to the company website. "By offering restaurant employees more opportunities to further their education and pursue their career aspirations, we are helping them find their full potential, whether that's at McDonald's or elsewhere," said CEO Steve Easterbrook in a statement. Workers can use the money to take classes at a community college, trade school, or four-year college of their choosing. The average annual cost of tuition and fees at a community college is $3,570. Related: Hotel industry wants to pay for their workers' college degrees About 55% of companies offer tuition assistance programs, according to the Society For Human Resource Management.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/23/pf/college/congress-fix-public-service-loan-forgiveness/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Congress gives new hope for those who didn't qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness|Some student loan borrowers will get another chance to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Congress has set aside $350 million to help fix what lawmakers have called a "glitch" in the enrollment process. Teachers, social workers, public defenders and others who work for the government or non-profits can qualify for student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of payments. But many who thought they were on track for forgiveness have since found out they were in a repayment plan that makes them ineligible for debt relief. The money was included in Congress's spending bill signed by President Donald Trump Friday. It funds the government through September. Many student loan borrowers have claimed their loan servicers led them to believe they qualified for the program, when they actually did not. Mike White, who works in higher education, said he was thrilled when the forgiveness program was announced in 2007. But he was recently told that none of his payments would count because he was in the wrong repayment plan. He had to switch into a new plan and start all over. But if the new funding makes his earlier payments eligible, he could see his debt erased in three years, instead of nine. "I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm curious to see what will really happen," he told CNN in an email Friday. Related: Lawsuits filed over Public Service Loan Forgiveness program Lawmakers have blamed the problem on complex program requirements. Separate bills were introduced in the House and Senate last year to find a solution. "Rather than let good actors slip through the cracks, we're fighting to provide relief to all those who fulfill the spirit of the program despite paperwork errors or bureaucratic complications," said Congressman Brendan Boyle in a statement when he introduced the original legislation in November. Borrowers are encouraged to submit a certification form annually to make sure their employer and loan repayment plan qualify. But that form wasn't made available until 2012, five years after the program launched. About 740,000 people had submitted the form as of last September, but 45% haven't made any qualifying payments, according to a Federal Student Aid document. Related: Is anyone actually getting public service loan forgiveness? Consumer advocates were pleasantly surprised to see the funding for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in the spending bill. "I think Congress is recognizing that communication was poor when it was first rolled out," said Betsy Mayotte, the president and founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors. It's hard to say how far the $350 million will go, she said. This is the first year borrowers would have had enough time to make 10 years of payments and receive forgiveness from the program. In January, the Department of Education said it expected fewer than 1,000 people to see their debt erased this year. Early data suggested that many borrowers who qualify have racked up large amounts of debt after going to law or medical school. Related: She thought her loans were forgiven. They weren't To qualify, a borrower must be enrolled in one of four income-driven repayment plans offered by the government. But there are other repayment plans that also lower monthly payments. As of May 23, borrowers in those plans may now qualify for forgiveness. But you must have already made 10 years of payments and applied to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program previously to qualify for expanded eligibility. The funds will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. If you think you may have become eligible for forgiveness, you must email FedLoan Servicing, the company handling applications to the forgiveness program. More information can be found on the federal student aid website here. Related: Want student loan forgiveness? Here's how to qualify The expanded eligibility will not help borrowers who may have had the wrong kind of loan while in a qualifying repayment program. Only loans from the federal Direct Loan Program are eligible. Some older borrowers may have Family Federal Education Loans, which still won't qualify. The additional funding came as the Trump Administration has proposed killing the program for future borrowers. It's not the only provision in the Department of Education's proposed budget that Congress ignored. The bill also increases the maximum Pell Grant amount for low-income students and expands the federal work-study program. But it does not include the $1 billion Secretary Betsy DeVos requested for school choice programs.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/12/news/economy/international-student-visa-college/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Sharp drop in international student visas worries some US colleges|A sharp decline in the number of international student visas has many of America's colleges and universities on edge -- and some say the Trump administration's tough stance on immigration might be partly to blame. The number of F-1 visas issued to foreign students seeking to attend college and other types of academic institutions in the United States decreased by 17% in the year that ended September 30, 2017, according to recent State Department data. "The current administration's 'America First' mantra is causing [international students] a great deal of anxiety and fear," said Earl Johnson, vice president of enrollment and student services at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. "Also, the cost of college tuition, on average, has gone up 40% in the last 10 years. It's weighing on them." That's bad news for schools that have large international student populations. Nearly 20% of the University of Tulsa's 4,400 enrolled students hail from overseas. Johnson said his school has experienced declines in international enrollment for a few years now and it is starting to hurt revenue. The university has even placed a school official in China to recruit more students from overseas. F-1 visa approvals were trending higher for nearly a decade when they peaked at more than 600,000 in 2015. But they have dropped off dramatically since. The United States issued a total of 393,573 F-1 visas in fiscal 2017, down from 471,728 in 2016. The government did not release the total number of F-1 visa applications it receives in a given year or how many applications were rejected. The biggest decline in visa approvals in 2017 was seen among students from Asian countries, particularly those from China and India which typically account for the largest number of F-1 visas. Related: College tuition is still getting more expensive A number of factors could be driving the declines, said Allan Goodman, president of the nonprofit Institute of International Education. While students are evaluating the cost of studying in the US versus somewhere else, they are also tuning in to the political rhetoric on immigration. "Inevitably, it does lead them to ask, 'Will I be welcome here?" said Goodman. But there are other factors that are also playing a role, he said. In China specifically, a 2014 change in visa policy allows Chinese students to obtain an F-1 visa for a five-year period instead of one, freeing them from having to renew their visa each year. That change alone could contribute to the recent declines, said Goodman. Worldwide competition for international students is also heating up, he said. The United States used to account for almost half of all international students worldwide. Now about 24% of all international students come here, said Goodman. Instead, they are going to countries like Canada, Germany and Australia, which are making it easier for international students to stay in the country after they graduate and become part of the workforce. Related: Despite DACA uncertainty, these Dreamers are still determined to go to college Meanwhile in the United States, the government's tougher stance on its popular H-1B foreign work visa, a common visa pathway for highly-skilled foreign workers, is making it harder for new graduates to remain in the country and could be deterring overseas students from applying to American colleges. While neither the law nor any regulations regarding foreign student visas have changed, the State Department said it has revised its guidance to US consulates that review and approve the applications. The agency said it now emphasizes that the consulates "must refuse" any applicants if they are "not satisfied that the applicant's present intent is to depart the United States at the conclusion of his or her study." "We believe that studying in the U.S. continues to provide the best educational opportunities in the world, introduces international students to networks that provide benefits and advantages well after their studies conclude, and gives graduates a life-long connection to the U.S," a State Department official said. "Having international students benefits the United States in many areas, in science and technology, even the number of Nobel laureates we produce," said Goodman. And international students add diversity to the classroom, he added. "Most Americans don't study abroad. At the very least, they get a sense of the outside world from the eight to 10 different nationalities in their classroom," he said. "It's a fairly uncertain time for all higher education institutions in the US," Johnson said. "Right now we feel the glass is half full. We are seeing a greater number of started applications from students overseas, but we have to wait and see how many complete their applications for the fall."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180312161716-university-of-tulsa-students-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/09/pf/college/hotel-employees-college-tuition-benefit/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Hotel industry wants to pay for their workers' college degrees|The hotel industry is using free tuition to try to lure — and keep — workers. The American Hotel and Lodging Association is rolling out a pilot program this month that offers an online associate's degree at no cost to workers and an online bachelor's degree at a subsidized cost. The goal is to attract and retain good employees. "We've had eight years of growth and job creation, but at the same time we have a labor shortage," said Katherine Lugar, president and CEO of the industry group. There are currently more than 700,000 job openings in the hospitality sector, according to government data. So far ten hotel brands and management companies have come on board — including New Castle Hotels and Resorts, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Red Roof Inns. Related: Hospitals offer big bonuses, free housing and tuition to recruit nurses It's up to the companies to pay the cost of the degrees. But the American Hotel and Lodging Association has partnered with Pearson to make the process easier. The education company negotiates with schools for lower prices, said Jim Homer who heads Pearson's AcceleratED Pathways program. They also vet the degree programs, making sure they are at accredited, nonprofit colleges. The funding and eligibility requirements for the benefit will vary by company. Not all will offer a bachelor's degree options, but those that do will subsidize the cost. For example, a worker with no previous college credits may end up paying about $24,000 for the bachelor's degree, Homer said. An associate's degree would be free to the employee. The average student pays about $10,000 each year in tuition in fees (without room and board) at an in-state public college when pursuing a bachelor's degree, according to The College Board. A two-year degree costs $3,520 a year, on average. Related: Student loan payments are the new employee perk At Wyndham, all employees at its managed properties will be eligible after 12 months of employment. The company will cover the full cost of tuition, fees, and books needed to finish an associate's degree. It may extend the program to bachelor's degrees in the future, said Becky Walnoha, Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Wyndham Managed Hotels. While Wyndham previously offered a tuition reimbursement benefit, the new program will pay the money up front. At New Castle, six employees are expected to qualify for the pilot program at first, said Gerry Chase, the president and COO at New Castle Hotels and Resorts. "They have to qualify to be selected. They have to be someone who shows initiative and we could see in management in the future. But they won't be required to stay with the company," he said. The industry association said many managers and executives have worked their way up from entry level positions — which don't often require college degrees. It puts the industry in a unique position to provide a pathway to higher education.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180308113344-wyndham-boston-hotel-file-780x439.jpg

Let's be clear. No lawmaker has proposed such a plan. But researchers at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College say it's a proposal worth considering. It's a "radical solution to the student debt crisis, but one that deserves serious attention, given the radical scope of the problem," wrote Marshall Steinbaum, one of the authors of the report, in a blog post. There is currently $1.4 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the US, held by about 44 million people. Nearly 70% of college seniors at nonprofit schools left with some debt in 2015. The researchers looked at what would happen if the government canceled all federal loans (the majority of student debt) and paid off all privately owned loans -— as a one-time policy. Their economic models show that canceling student debt would lead to a boost in GDP by an average of $86 billion to $108 billion annually over the next 10 years. They also show that it would reduce the unemployment rate by about 0.3%. Related: Yes, student debt is delaying homeownership Meanwhile the cost of paying off $1.4 trillion of debt would have a "modest" effect on the deficit and inflation over the next 10 years, the report said. In his post, Steinbaum addressed two possible criticisms: that eliminating student debt is inequitable because the largest balances are held by the highest-income borrowers, and that the debt isn't a significant drag on the economy to begin with, since a college degree generally leads to higher earnings. But Steinbaum says that those critiques are "much less true than they are commonly believed." Some critics of debt cancellation also worry that current and future borrowers could borrow even more, expecting their debt to be forgiven, too. The research did not account for a potential moral hazard, though the paper suggests that using public funds to make colleges tuition- or debt-free could help avert the problem. Related: How they typical graduate student pays for school While the biggest debts are held by those who go to graduate school and earn big salaries, like doctors and lawyers, student debt is increasingly held by a larger portion of the population as the cost of education has risen, Steinbaum said. Erasing all student debt is ambitious. But forgiveness programs do exist for some federal loan borrowers. Those who work in the public sector may be eligible to have their remaining debt forgiven after 10 years of payments. Another program provides debt relief for some teachers. And those enrolled in an income-driven repayment program may be eligible for debt forgiveness after 20 or 25 years.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201165936-student-loan-forgiveness-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/02/pf/college/public-service-student-loan-forgiveness/index.html?section=money_pf_college|Is anyone actually getting public service loan forgiveness?|The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program turned 10 last year. So far, about 7,500 people have applied to have their student loans discharged, but fewer than 1,000 are expected to qualify this year, the Department of Education has told CNNMoney. The forgiveness program was created in 2007 under President George W. Bush. Borrowers who work for the government or a non-profit can apply to have their remaining debt wiped away after making 10 years of payments. It was meant to encourage people with student debt to remain in lower-paying jobs that serve the public -- like public defenders, social workers, and Peace Corps workers. October of 2017 was the first time anyone could have made enough monthly payments to qualify for debt forgiveness. About 7,500 people had applied for forgiveness as of January 5. But the Department of Education was "unable" to say whether any had been approved or rejected to date, a spokeswoman said in an email. If just 1,000 are deemed eligible over the first year as the department expects, that would represent about 13% of those who have applied. The low number is partly due to the limited pool of borrowers who were eligible for the program when it first launched, according to the Department of Education. Dozens of borrowers have told CNNMoney they believed they were making qualified payments when they weren't -- blaming their loan servicers for providing them with misinformation. Some say they planned their careers around the program, only to learn years later that their loan payments did not qualify. Related: Borrowers sue over Public Service Loan Forgiveness program To qualify, a borrower must have a federal loan from the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, as well as be enrolled in an income-based repayment plan. But in 2007, an estimated 25% of the total federal loan portfolio consisted of Direct loans, the spokeswoman said. Most borrowers at that time had loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. There were also fewer qualifying repayment plans at that time. Since then, the government has ended making new loans from the FFEL program and most borrowers have Direct loans instead. Borrowers with older FFEL loans aren't completely out of luck. They can ask their loan servicer to consolidate their loans into a Direct loan, making them eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The catch, though, is that no previous payments will count toward the 10 years of payments needed before debt is canceled. While the Direct program was available at the time the forgiveness program began, the consolidation process could delay some borrowers from taking advantage of it right away. People have also reported experiencing delays with loan servicers while they certify their income each year for the purpose of remaining in an income-based repayment program, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has said. Related: She thought her loans were forgiven. They weren't A handful of borrowers have filed lawsuits against their loan servicers over the matter. Amanda Lawson-Ross, a counselor at the University of Florida, believed she had made four years of qualifying payments when a service representative told her otherwise. Now, she has to consolidate her loans into the Direct program and start all over. Part of the problem is that there was no formal process in place for borrowers to find out if they qualified when the program launched in 2007 -- leaving them to rely on what their servicer told them. An employer certification form was eventually made available in 2012, but borrowers are not required to submit it prior to making all the payments. Currently, the Department of Education recommends that those who want to take advantage of the forgiveness program submit the employer form as soon as they can. It will confirm whether they have the right type of loan and if their employer qualifies. As of January 5, about 800,000 borrowers had submitted at least one employer certification form. Related: Betsy DeVos limits debt relief for defrauded students Once someone makes all 10 years' worth of payments, they then must submit an application for forgiveness. The Trump administration has proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program for new borrowers. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that ending the program would save the government $24 billion over the next decade. Eliminating the program would require an act of Congress, which is currently considering a rewrite of the federal law that oversees higher education. A House version of the bill would end the program for new borrowers. A Senate version is expected to be introduced this spring. Have you received forgiveness from the public service program?

http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/11/pf/college/graduate-students-pay-for-school/index.html?section=money_pf_college|How graduate students pay for school|When Zerleen Quader was applying to Ph.D. programs in epidemiology, she sought out a college that would cover the cost of her tuition. "Some programs guarantee you'll be funded, but it varies. I really tried to find one that would fund me from the beginning," Quader said. Emory University in Atlanta offered to pay her tuition for the first two years, and she enrolled last fall. For future years, she plans to apply for research grants, or work for a professor with an already-funded project. But most graduate students don't get that kind of financial help. About 60% of grad students don't receive any kind of scholarship, grant, or tuition waiver that they don't have to pay back, according to a report released Wednesday. The study, conducted by Sallie Mae and Ipsos, sheds light on how graduate students pay for school. For many, it's a combination of loans and savings or income that pays the bill. The average student said they faced $24,812 in expenses for one year, and that loans covered half that amount. But prices greatly varied. The average one-year cost for medical and law students was higher than $30,000. The survey was conducted in the spring of 2017, and included 1,597 part-time and full-time graduate students pursuing master's, doctoral, and professional degrees. Related: This forgiveness program became a student loan nightmare The report points out that graduate students are far more self-reliant than undergrads. Money they have saved, earned, or borrowed, covers 77% of the costs for the average grad student, while undergrads receive more in the way of scholarships and grants, and get help from their parents. When grad students do receive scholarships or grants, it's typically from the university. Unlike undergrads, they're usually not eligible for federal need-based Pell grants or state-funded grants. More than three-quarters of graduate students take out loans. Quader did, too, for her master's program at the University of Minnesota. She received a scholarship for her first year there and then borrowed about $20,000 to pay for her second. "I was pretty comfortable taking out those loans because it's the norm for a master's in public health program. Everyone has to take out a loan for it," Quader said. She borrowed student loans from the federal government. Generally, graduate students who are U.S. citizens can borrow up to $20,500 a year from the Direct Loan program and additional funds -- up to the full cost of attendance -- from the PLUS program. "Grad students can borrow more than undergrads, but the rates are higher and they can't get subsidized loans," said Kalman Chany, the author of Paying for College Without Going Broke from The Princeton Review. For the current year, the fixed interest rate on Direct Loans for graduate students is 6% and it's 7% on PLUS loans. Yet, just 34% of students with loans said they used a Direct Loan and 24% used a PLUS loan. "I'm surprised more students aren't taking these student loans. It could be that they are unfamiliar with the process and didn't realize they could qualify" Chany said. Related: The best ways to borrow money for school, if you have to Of those who borrowed money, 21% said they used a credit card (which can have a higher interest rate than federal loans) and 19% said they used a student loan from a private lender, which typically bases the rate on your finances. About 16% borrowed money from a friend or family member. More students said they were worried about the length of time it would take them to repay their debts than those who said they were worried about being able to make the payments. Still, 32% said they were very worried their loan payments would interfere with making other financial decisions, the report said. Quader, who took out loans for just her second year of her master's got a job right away and was able to pay off her debt within three years -- before starting her Ph.D. program. Living at home with her parents helped, she said. For now, Quader is living off a stipend she receives for doing research at the university and her savings. "I haven't had to take out a loan so far. But it's tight, for sure," she said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161104121208-wealthy-college-endowment-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/03/pf/college/new-york-college-food-pantries/index.html?section=money_pf_college|New York governor wants food pantries at every state college|New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wants each state college to have a food pantry for students. It's one of many proposals he included in his annual State of the State report. The plan would require all public colleges to either provide food pantries on campus, or come up with a "stigma-free" way for students to consistently have access to healthy foods. Cuomo is asking state lawmakers to provide $1 million to the State University of New York (SUNY) and City University of New York (CUNY) systems to implement the program. Chancellors at both schools applauded the proposal, which could help expand their existing efforts. A 2015 survey done by CUNY indicated that nearly 15% of its students go hungry at some point because they can't afford to buy enough food. More than half of its 24 campuses already have food pantries. SUNY launched a task force to study the issue in November. The school said that 70% of its 64 campuses either have food pantries on site or have a partnership with a local community pantry. Related: There's a hunger problem on America's college campuses The issue of food insecurity on college campuses has been drawing nationwide attention. Some public policy advocates say it's a growing problem, but critics say food pantries are simply doling out undeserved handouts. In a recent national survey, nearly half of students said they had experienced food insecurity (having limited access to nutritious food) within the past 30 days. There are at least 573 colleges with food pantries in the U.S., according to the College and University Food Bank Alliance. Temple University professor Sara Goldrick-Rab, who studies the issue, said she was optimistic that Cuomo's proposal would move the conversation forward. "I've got to say, while it's not exactly how I might craft this, it's nonetheless a big deal. Hardly any governors have recognized this as an issue outside Jerry Brown," said Goldrick-Rab, who is also the founder of the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, which seeks ways to make college more affordable. Brown, the governor of California, pushed for including $7.5 million in the state budget last year to address food insecurity on college campuses. But more can be done to address food insecurity in addition to food pantries, Goldrick-Rab said. The University of Albany, for example, has instituted a Swipe Out Hunger program that allows students to donate their unused meal credits at the end of the semester. Goldrick-Rab and other advocates would like to see campuses make sure students know how to sign up for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits if they're eligible, and ensure they can use those benefits on campus. Providing small emergency grants to students could also help. It may mean those who have found themselves strapped for cash when dealing with a one-time incident -- like a car breaking down -- may not have to forgo meals. "But these are all Band-Aids. The state has to grapple with why students are becoming food insecure," Goldrick-Rab said. Related: She's on a mission to make America's colleges hunger-free Cuomo's plan to require food pantries on every campus is just one part of his "No Student Goes Hungry Program," which would affect students in kindergarten through college. It aims to end "lunch shaming" by banning alternative lunches sometimes given to students who can't afford to pay. In some cases, these students are currently given lesser-quality lunches, a press release said. It would also ensure that schools required to provide breakfast to do so after the school day has begun, making it more accessible to students. It would expand the state's investment in its "Farm to School" program and provide more incentives for schools to buy locally-grown foods. The program will need approval from the state legislature, where control is currently split between Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Assembly. Last year Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed making tuition free at public colleges for students whose families earn less than $125,000 a year. Lawmakers approved the plan and included funding for the scholarship in the budget. It went into effect his past fall. Progressive policies like this one have drawn national attention for Cuomo, stirring talk of a possible presidential run. He called the state a "vanguard for social progress" in his address on Wednesday.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161205143600-montclair-state-food-pantry-shelves-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/pf/insurance/las-vegas-shooting-health-care/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|Las Vegas shooting victims struggle to afford mounting medical costs|Kurt Fowler and his wife, Trina, were celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary at a country music festival when the shooting started. Fowler, 41, knew he'd been hit in the ankle and couldn't run. He hid under the stage until the gunfire ended. "I knew my foot was completely useless," said Fowler, a firefighter from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and a father of three. He underwent surgery, spent nearly two weeks in the hospital and still may need another operation. He also will need rehabilitation and follow-up visits with a specialist. Fowler has a Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO through his job, but he said he doesn't know how much he will have to pay out of his own pocket for the care he is receiving. In an era of higher deductibles and limited choice of in-network doctors, however, he knows he could face significant medical bills. His insurance card says his individual deductible is $5,000 and his coinsurance 20%. He said he didn't know how much his health plan would cover for out-of-state care. "Medical expenses are astronomical these days," Fowler said from his bed at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas. "It's a mountain that just doesn't seem like it's gonna be climbable, but we are gonna do our best." As hundreds of survivors struggle to recover emotionally and physically from the Oct. 1 attack, they are beginning to come to terms with the financial toll of the violence perpetrated against them. Even those who are insured could face untold costs in a city they were only visiting. The total costs of medical care alone could reach into the tens of millions of dollars, said Garen Wintemute, who researches gun violence at the University of California-Davis. And that is just the beginning. Many survivors will be out of work for months, if they are able to return at all. "We really don't have a good handle on the intangible costs of something like this ... the ripple effects on family and friends and neighborhoods when a large number of people have been shot," Wintemute said. More than 100,000 people are shot every year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That generates about $2.8 billion per year in emergency room and inpatient charges alone, according to a recent study in Health Affairs. The average emergency room bill for an individual gunshot victim is $5,254 and the average inpatient charge is $95,887, according to the study. Related: Patients pay the price when hospital giants hire your private practitioner The U.S. senators representing Nevada, Dean Heller and Catherine Cortez Masto, wrote a letter to America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, and Scott Serota, CEO of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, requesting help with out-of-network bills, copayments and deductibles for the Las Vegas shooting victims. Many of the people who were shot had traveled from other states, including California, Iowa and Tennessee. California and some states protect consumers from such bills, but Nevada is not one of them, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. But Corlette said most insurers allow patients to request exceptions based on the circumstances. "In this situation, I imagine most insurers are going to want to be compassionate and work something out," she said. The victims and their families aren't the only ones who will be affected financially by the mass shooting. Taxpayers, too, pick up much of the tab for the health care costs associated with gun violence because many patients are covered by Medicaid and Medicare, two government insurance programs. Related: Zappos offers to help cover funeral costs of every Las Vegas shooting victim And hospitals will also be on the hook for some of the care for patients who don't have insurance. Hospitals in Las Vegas quickly mobilized to treat the hundreds of victims who were streaming in that night, and they don't know yet how much of the care will be reimbursed. At Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, staff treated more than 200 patients. Sunrise plans to file insurance claims and will "be extremely sensitive to the financial status" of patients when considering their out-of-pocket portions, a spokeswoman said. Valley Hospital Medical Center is encouraging patients to complete paperwork for a state program called Nevada Victims of Violent Crime, which would pay their balances. And Dignity Health's St. Rose Dominican said it will bill insurers and accept donations but will not require payment from victims. California victims can also get help with medical expenses and income loss from the California Victim Compensation Board. In addition, a GoFundMe account started by a Clark County commissioner has raised $11 million thus far. And many survivors have individual GoFundMe accounts. Related: Doctors in Puerto Rico: 'Reality here is post-apocalyptic' Fowler's GoFundMe page has raised about $39,000. Fowler said he doesn't have disability insurance so he will rely on the funds to help cover his expenses while he is recovering and missing work. Michael Caster, 41, who lives in Indio, California, has a GoFundMe account that has raised about $26,000 so far. He's paralyzed from the waist down after a bullet lodged in his spine. At Sunrise Hospital, doctors drained the blood from Caster's lungs and removed some of the bullet fragments. Sitting in a hospital bed 11 days after the shooting, Caster said he didn't know how much of his care would be covered by his health insurance. He works in human resources at a California hospital and has a job-sponsored policy with Anthem Blue Cross. "I've never really dealt with injury," he said. "I don't want to be stuck with a bunch of bills." His bills could rise further: That day, he was scheduled to be flown to a rehabilitation center in Colorado for people with spinal cord injuries. Mary Moreland, whose daughter Tina Frost was shot during the country music festival, said that at first she didn't understand why so many families were setting up fundraisers. Then, the severe financial strain the shooting would take started to dawn on her. Now, Moreland said she's grateful for the nearly $580,000 raised through GoFundMe. Frost, a resident of San Diego, had emergency brain surgery the night of the shooting. A bullet had pierced her eye and exploded in her brain. As she lay in ICU earlier this month, her mother said small improvements were major milestones. "Today she squeezed my hands," Moreland said. Related: Actually Trump is raising health insurance premiums The next night, Frost came out of a medically induced coma and was later flown to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, near her mother's home. Over the next weeks and months, she will need multiple operations and a slew of specialists, including neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, occupational therapists and mental health counselors. Moreland said she cannot even begin to imagine what her daughter's care will cost. Frost has Blue Cross insurance through her job at Ernst & Young in San Diego, but Moreland said she doesn't know what the deductible and copayments are. "Being realistic, knowing what I know about costs of health care, it's scary," Moreland said. "But she's alive. She's not one of the 58 other people."

http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/12/autos/suv-headlights/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|These SUVs have lousy headlights|If you're driving a small SUV, chances are that your headlights are pretty crummy. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tested the headlights on 21 small SUVs, and not one earned the top rating of Good for lighting performance. Only four were even rated Acceptable. Headlight performance is critical because, according the Institute, about half of traffic deaths occur at night or during the low-light hours of dawn or dusk. The report adds that headlights are often overlooked in favor of "jazzier high-tech crash avoidance features." Headlights in luxury cars rated no better than mainstream models, according to the Institute. Even high-tech headlights, like the adaptive ones that turn along with the front wheels, offered no guarantee of better performance. The only four small SUVs to earn Acceptable ratings were the Honda (HMC) CR-V, Mazda (MZDAF) CX-3, Hyundai (HYMTF) Tucson and the 2017 model year Ford (F) Escape. And even these Acceptable ratings only apply to specific versions of these models. For example, the rating applies only to the Limited version of the Hyundai Tucson. Other versions of the Tucson have headlights that rated Poor. Among the dozen SUVs that earned a Poor rating were the Audi (VLKPY) Q3, Buick (GM) Encore, Honda HR-V and Subaru (FUJHY) Forester. And none of those 12 models even offer better headlights as an option. The HR-V had the worst headlights out of all of them. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which makes Fiat and Jeep vehicles, Nissan and Honda all pointed out that their headlights meet or exceed all applicable safety standards. Kia and General Motors (GM) declined to comment. The Insurance Institute tested headlights at night on a test track. The lights were tested on straightaways as well as on left-hand and right-hand curves. Researchers tested how far the SUVs lights traveled, as well as whether oncoming vehicles experienced excessive glare. "SUV headlights are mounted higher than car headlights, so they generally should be aimed lower," said Insurance Institute Senior Research Engineer Matthew Brumbelow. "Instead, many of them are aimed higher than the car headlights we've tested so far." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is a private group financed by auto insurers. It conducts its own crash tests and other safety tests that are different from those conducted by the federal government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160711141134-car-night-headlights-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/24/investing/aetna-obamacare-humana-merger/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|Aetna lied about why it dropped some Obamacare coverage|A federal judge has ruled that Aetna wasn't being truthful when the health insurer said last summer that its decision to pull out of most Obamacare exchanges was strictly a business decision triggered by mounting losses. U.S. District Judge John Bates concluded this week that Aetna's real motivation for dropping Obamacare coverage in several states was "specifically to evade judicial scrutiny" over its merger with Humana. Aetna pulled out of Obamacare exchanges in 11 states last August, including 17 counties in Florida, Georgia and Missouri where the Department of Justice argued the merger would wipe out competition. That decision to retreat from Obamacare came just a month after the Department of Justice blocked Aetna's $34 billion merger with Humana on antitrust grounds. But Bates said this week the DOJ presented "persuasive support" -- including internal Aetna emails -- for the conclusion that Aetna (AET) withdrew from the Obamacare exchanges in those counties "to improve its litigation position." "The Court does not credit the minimal efforts of Aetna executives to claim otherwise," Bates wrote in a ruling following a trial over the merger. He added that Aetna's decision regarding participation in the 2017 exchanges in these counties was "in fact manipulated." Related: Trump and Obamacare: Where we go from here Aetna had warned the government it may need to dump then-President Obama's signature healthcare law if the U.S. scuttled its deal with Humana (HUM). "It is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely...should our deal ultimately be blocked," Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini wrote in a letter to the DOJ last July that was obtained by the Huffington Post. However, Bates said it's clear that "Aetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchange for favorable treatment" from regulators. The judge said there is "persuasive evidence" that when Aetna later withdrew from the 17 counties in question, "it did not do so for business reasons, but instead to follow through on the threat that it made earlier." This critique was buried in a 158-page ruling issued by Bates on Monday, in which he blocked Aetna's merger with Humana due to anti-competitive concerns. The ruling deals a big blow to both companies at a time of great uncertainty in the health care industry now that President Donald Trump has talked about rolling back several key provisions of Obamacare. Aetna-Humana isn't the only big health care merger in doubt. The DOJ also sued to block the takeover of Cigna (CI) by Blue Cross Blue Shield leader Anthem (ANTX) for anti-competitive reasons. Aetna declined to comment on specifics of the opinion, including the criticism from Bates, because it's still "reviewing the details." Related: Even as they repeal Obamacare, Republicans still have to fund it Last summer, Aetna explained its decision to withdraw from most Obamacare exchanges by saying its individual policies business had lost $430 million since the exchanges opened in January 2014. However, the judge noted that Aetna kept its support for exchanges in money-losing states like Delaware, Iowa and Virginia -- but dumped Florida, even though that big state was projected to be profitable in 2016. The ruling quoted an email from Christopher Ciano, president of Aetna's Florida market, to Jonathan Mayhew, head of Aetna's exchange business, showing how stunned he was by the decision to leave Florida. "I just can't make sense out of the Florida decision. Never thought we would pull the plug all together," Ciano wrote, adding that Aetna was "making money from the on-exchange business." Mayhew responded by requesting to discuss by phone "instead of email." Bates said the response from the senior Aetna exec was an example of Aetna's "repeated efforts to conceal a paper trail about this decision-making." --CNNMoney's Tami Luhby contributed to this report|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170124115231-aetna-obamacare-780x439.jpg

Now you can also insure against cyberbullies. Global insurance giant Chubb (CB) recently launched a new cyberbullying insurance for wealthy clients across the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. This is the first time this type of insurance has been offered in the region, said Chubb. Chubb said it will shell out as much as £50,000 ($74,600) to help clients and their families recover from online trolls. As part of the package, Chubb will pay PR professionals to help a client repair reputational damage and will pay cyber-security professionals to help a client build a strong legal case if the matter is brought to court. Plus, it will pay for lost income or tuition fees if a client has to miss work or school. And it will cover temporary relocation costs if a client has to move as a result of trolling. "The intention is to cover any related costs that may occur as a result of cyberbullying," said Tara Parchment, a client manager at Chubb. But the new insurance can't be purchased as a stand-alone product. It's only included in Chubb's top-of-the-line home insurance package, which costs at least £2,500 ($3,730) per year and is targeted at high-net-worth individuals. Just how bad does the cyberbullying have to get before you call Chubb? Parchment said a client can seek coverage after experiencing more than three acts of cyberbullying that resulted in a financial loss. The client would have to undergo harassment, intimidation and/or threats of libel, slander or violence. So run-of-the-mill online taunting wouldn't be enough to trigger payouts.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/130604120836-cyber-security-espionage-1024x576.jpg

The company announced Friday that new moms will be able to take 24 weeks of leave at full pay following the birth of their child -- an increase from 10 weeks at 80% pay. New dads, who previously weren't offered any paid leave, will be offered 12 weeks at full pay.

Paid parental leave is not mandated in the U.S., and according to the Labor Department, 12% of private sectors workers get paid family leave. However, companies, particularly in the tech industry, have been revamping their parental benefits to help attract and retain workers. Last week, Facebook (FB) enhanced its global paternity leave, and streaming service Spotify recently announced new moms and dads can take six months of paid leave following birth or adoption. In early November, Amazon (AMZN) increased its paid leave to new moms to 20 weeks while dads can take six weeks. But it's not just tech companies increasing their benefits: Credit Suisse announced it will give new moms and dads in the U.S. 20 weeks of paid leave starting in 2016.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151204144937-ebay-campus-san-jose-california-780x439.jpg

A single 20-year-old pays 21% more than a married 20-year-old for the same policy, a new study from InsuranceQuotes.com found. To an insurer, it comes down to statistics -- and singles get into more accidents. Married drivers might be more cautious since they're more likely to have kids, said Laura Adams, an analyst an InsuranceQuotes.com. Drivers in their 20's who are married actually get bigger discounts than married drivers in their 30's, who only get a roughly 3% break. Gender and age also play a big role in what drivers pay. Men pay more than women when they're younger. A 20-year-old man pays 22% more than a woman the same age for the same policy, the report found.

Geico is accused of failing to offer policies that offer the minimum amount of coverage legally required to these drivers, which also happen to have the lowest premiums, according to the Consumer Federation of California. In fact, insurance companies are required by state law to offer good drivers this option. Geico is actually owned by Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), which is run by Warren Buffett, a billionaire who often speaks up for the little guy. An idea that's been dubbed the "Buffett Rule" is that billionaires like himself should never pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle class family pays. Buffett has also advocated for a higher earned income tax credit, which helps low-income working families. Related: The rich are 8 times likelier to graduate college than the poor Insurance companies must offer good drivers plans with the minimum level of coverage OK'd by the state. In California the lowest coverage policy covers up to $15,000 for a single injury in an accident, $30,000 for injury to more than one person, and $5,000 for property damage. But the Consumer Federation of California found that this policy was not being offered to some drivers in California who asked for quotes online. It charges that drivers who are single, lack a college degree, are currently uninsured, unemployed or not working an a professional job. The group contends that it offers these individuals plan with higher limits and higher premiums. It also claims that Geico still labels this option as a "lowest limit" coverage plan. A majority of people already choose insurance plans that offer more than the minimum coverage, said Michael Barry at the Insurance Information Institute. The Consumer Federation of California filed a complaint Thursday with the California Department of Insurance.

http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/23/technology/security/obamacare-website-privacy/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|Obamacare website reins in personal data sharing|The government has stopped openly sharing your personal information from the Obamacare website with private companies. Earlier this week, the government came under fire after the Associated Press showed that Healthcare.gov was relaying users' personal information, such as zip code, income level, pregnancy status and whether or not you are a smoker. That information was being shared with Google (GOOG), Twitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO) and other companies that track people online, like the advertisement display service DoubleClick. The evidence was on the website code itself. But on Friday, CNNMoney read the code and found that Healthcare.gov was no longer relaying personal information to DoubleClick and others. Obama administration officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. But in a statement Saturday, a top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wrote that the agency has added "a layer of encryption that reduces the information available to the third party tools we use from our URLs." The change followed an internal review of Healthcare.gov's privacy policies, marketplace CEO Kevin Counihan wrote. After the initial reports about the privacy problems, Republican Senators Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley wrote a letter to the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demanding answers. Citing Healthcare.gov's many technology glitches, they wrote: "This new information is extremely concerning, not only because it violates the privacy of millions of Americans, but because it may potentially compromise their security." To be fair, the software tools used by Healthcare.gov were popular services that help improve a website's design (CNNMoney uses them). But health officials would not explain why DoubleClick, a company in the advertising industry that already tracks people's browsing habits, should be allowed to know whether users smoke or are pregnant. For its part, Google told CNNMoney it doesn't desire your personal health information anyway. "We don't want and don't use that kind of data," said Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman. "And we don't allow DoubleClick systems to be used to target ads based on health or medical history information." Related: Obamacare employer mandate is eased When CNNMoney learned that the Health and Human Services Department was sending information to third parties in 2013, HHS would only assure that the data being shared with DoubleClick and others is transmitted to them securely. That approach was criticized by privacy advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Noah Lang, CEO of a health insurance startup Stride Health, said use of those tracking tools was sloppy and uncalled for. "I don't think it's necessary to build a great user experience," he said. "Should they be sending identifying information to a third-party advertiser? The pretty clear answer there is no. It's a massive breach of personal privacy." When CNNMoney read through the computer code on the Healthcare.gov website on Friday, certain lines of code that indicated the website was sending such personal information during the sign-up process were gone. Cooper Quintin, a staff technologist at EFF, confirmed that the code was gone. "That's a great first step for them to take," he said. While Healthcare.gov is no longer relaying your personal information on the front end, there's no telling what information might get shared once it is stored in the government's computers, however. --CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150123140811-healthcare-gov-computer-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/real_estate/fha-mortgage-insurance/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|FHA to lower cost of mortgage insurance|In an effort to make owning a home more affordable, the Federal Housing Administration will dramatically cut the costs associated with the mortgages it backs. Premiums for FHA mortgage insurance, which is designed to protect the agency in case a borrower defaults on a loan, will be cut from 1.35% of a loan's value to about 0.85%, the White House said in a statement Thursday. Related: Return of the first time home buyer As a result, a typical first-time homebuyer will save $900 a year on their mortgage payments. Existing homeowners who refinance into an FHA loan will see similar savings. "Too many creditworthy families who can afford -- and want to purchase -- a home are shut out of homeownership opportunities due to today's tight lending market," the White House said. The White House estimates that the lower premiums will enable up to 250,000 new buyers to purchase a home. Related: Five biggest threats to the housing recovery In the wake of the financial meltdown and ensuing foreclosure crisis, FHA raised its mortgage insurance premiums to shore up its finances. But now home values are on the rise, the jobs picture is improving and foreclosures have fallen to their lowest level since 2006. Last March, the FHA announced it would not need another bailout due to improving financial conditions. The White House said that even after lowering premiums, reserves in the fund are projected to grow by $7 billion to $10 billion annually. Related: Fannie, Freddie to offer 3% down payment mortgages FHA loans have been an important lifeline for low-income and higher risk borrowers in the wake of the financial crisis.

He's from Queens! Or that's what he said, anyway, in an open letter to the Local 54 union, which represents casino workers in Atlantic City, NJ, where four casinos have closed and 8,000 workers lost their jobs, just this year. "I grew up on the streets of Queens," wrote Icahn, one of the best-known activist investors. "I learned to fight bullies and that was great training because I later built my fortune fighting the establishment -- mostly CEOs and boards that I felt were taking advantage of the shareholders." Icahn said he was going to invest $100 million in the Trump Taj Mahal, and save it from becoming the next casino to go out of business. However, he said he would do it only if the union agreed to give up health care benefits. So far, the union has refused. Icahn said he would pay each worker an extra $2,000 and they would be eligible for Obamacare or Medicaid. (Though Icahn refers to it as the Trump Taj Mahal, the casino doesn't carry Donald Trump's name any more.) Related: The Donald tears his name from Trump Taj Mahal Icahn said the union is stalling the deal. "The Taj Mahal is quickly running out of money and will almost certainly close," he wrote. "Reprehensibly, the union, instead of working with ... the company to keep the Taj Mahal alive, is instead doing everything to destroy the possibility of saving the jobs of almost 3,000 employees." The Taj Mahal casino is managed by Trump Entertainment Resorts, also is not owned by The Donald. The company also owned Trump Plaza Casino, also in Atlantic City, which went out of business.

http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/19/real_estate/homeowners-insurance-claims/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|One property claim can cause your premiums to soar by hundreds of dollars|File just one property claim to your insurer and you can expect to see your premiums soar by hundreds of dollars in some states. On average, filing a single claim -- for anything ranging from a stolen bicycle to tornado damage -- will result in your monthly premium being raised by 9%, according to a report released by InsuranceQuotes.com. File a second claim and premiums climb by an average of 20%. "Winning a small claim could actually cost you money in the long run," said Laura Adams, InsuranceQuotes.com's senior analyst. "Homeowners need to be really careful. Even a denied claim can cause your premium to go up." Related: Which natural disaster will likely destroy your home? And the size of the claim has little impact. Filing a small claim increases your rates by just about as much as filing a catastrophic one. "The insurers have found that people who make a claim are more likely to make another," said Adams. "You've become a riskier customer." Yet, the type of claim does matter. Liability claims, such as from personal injuries, are the most expensive type of claim, with insurers raising premiums by an average of 14%, InsuranceQuotes.com found. Other claims that lead to big premium increases are theft and vandalism, which often indicate that the home is in a neighborhood that is unstable or falling prey to blight. In bad neighborhoods, these crimes can recur, and the high premiums reflect that. The premium increases also vary greatly by state. Homeowners in Wyoming saw the biggest increase in their premiums -- an average of 32% -- after a claim was filed. While the hikes are high, the state tends to charge fairly low premiums of about $770 a year, considerably lower than the $978 national average. Policyholders in Connecticut, Arizona, New Mexico and California also saw large hikes of 18% or more. Meanwhile, homeowners in Texas, where insurers are not allowed to raise premiums on the basis of a single claim, saw no increase. And homeowners in New York and Massachusetts paid very little more after filing claims. Average premiums range from a low of $513 a year in Idaho to $1,933 in Florida, where frequent hurricanes drive insurance costs up. Once your premiums are raised, it can be difficult to get them reduced. Insurers keep a database called the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, or CLUE, which tracks seven years' worth of your auto and property insurance claims, as well as any inquiries you may have made about a claim. The database then compiles a report based on your claims history that is then used to determine whether to cover you and how much to charge. The information is available to all insurers so even if you switch providers, your rate with the new carrier may be just as high. Related: Damaged home? How to get an insurer to pay up "You can't escape your claim history," said Adams. But you are not completely without hope. Here are some ways to try and keep your homeowner's insurance costs down: Raise your deductible. But not so high that you can't afford to pay out-of-pocket costs if damage occurs. Don't make small claims. Getting a few hundred dollars back if a tree limb falls on your shed may feel good but you could be paying that back to your insurer over the next few years -- and then some. Don't use homeowners insurance as a maintenance tool. Don't file a claim to pay for small repairs, such as when wind blows some old shingles off your roof. Use it for catastrophic repairs only. Shop around often. Look for quotes once a year. There's lots of competition in the industry and you may be able to buy equal coverage and service for a lower price.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/141016133204-homeowners-insurance-claims-1024x576.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/pf/insurance/earthquake-insurance-cost/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|3 reasons why Californians shun earthquake insurance|Even though 90% of the earthquakes that strike the United States are located in California, only about 10% of homeowners there have earthquake insurance. What gives? Here are three reasons why many quake-prone Californians shun insurance: 1) Quake damage rarely exceeds deductibles. Some argue the insurance is not worth the money for homeowners. Earthquake insurance generally comes with a deductible of 15% of the home's value, according to John Rundle, a professor of physics at the University of California, Davis. "Most homeowners will never exceed the deductible even if they do get damage," he said. Related: Natural disaster -- the riskiest spots in the USA Most policies are purchased from the California Earthquake Authority, a privately funded, publicly managed organization that was created by the state legislature after severe losses in the Northridge quake threatened to send private insurers packing. Glenn Pomeroy, CEO of CEA, said he would love to have a zero deductible, but that would make the premiums unaffordable for homeowners. Check out what you would pay on the CEA calculator. The big deductibles mean money that would have gone to paying insurance premiums might be better spent being invested in temblor resistant home retrofits, according to Rundle. Homeowners could get their houses bolted to bedrock, for example, or braced and reinforced to prevent them from shaking apart. Related: The 10 most expensive U.S. earthquakes 2) Californians were slammed by the housing bust. Many Californians were hurt by the real estate crisis and have little or no home equity -- or are underwater on their mortgages. Jason Simpson, a computer programmer in Sherman Oaks, Calif., outside Los Angeles, bought his $690,000 home with a 3% down mortgage in 2008. The housing bust pushed him underwater -- he soon owed more on his loan than his home was worth. Related: Mansion that measures earthquakes "With no equity, there was no reason to drop $1,200 a year," he said. If the big one had hit, he would have simply walked away from his mortgage. Now, however, as home prices have rebounded and he has added on to the house, he's preparing to buy insurance. 3) Mistrust of the California Earthquake Authority's support. Another factor discouraging homeowners from buying coverage is that the CEA would stop paying claims if catastrophic earthquake losses exceed the the Authority's reserves. Pomeroy said that homeowners shouldn't worry. Even though, just like any insurer, CEA would stop paying claims once its ability to pay was exceeded, it won't happen. CEA is very well capitalized, he said. "We could handle two Northridges," he said, about the costliest earthquake in U.S. history. "I don't lose sleep worrying whether we have enough money to pay claims, I worry because so many people don't have coverage."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140825153643-earthquake-damage-napa-1024x576.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/05/pf/college/student-loans-insurance/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|Big student loans? Consider life insurance|If you're co-signing big student loans for your child, you may want to buy a life insurance policy while you're at it. While no one wants to imagine the death of their child, taking out insurance on your son or daughter -- or asking them to purchase their own plan -- will protect you from being hit with mountains of debt should tragedy strike. And the policies are pretty cheap. A basic plan with up to $250,000 in coverage can cost as little as $15 a month for a young, healthy college student or recent graduate. That's a whole lot less than the loan payments you could be stuck with -- which average more than $200 a month. Related: Parents hit with $200,000 student loan bill Such a move would have been life altering to Steve and Darnelle Mason, who lost their daughter Lisa five years ago. Trying to pay back the $100,000 in private student loans they co-signed for their daughter has been a financial nightmare. "I absolutely wish we had [a life insurance] policy," said Steve Mason. "We would not have struggled financially for the past four years with these private student loans, and our credit would not have been ruined." Federal student loans are forgiven by the lender when a borrower dies, but private lenders aren't required to provide any such relief. That's one reason it's important to get as much federal aid as possible before turning to private lenders. And for parents, it means not co-signing on a loan unless you have the means to repay it. Another reason for caution: student loans can rarely be discharged in bankruptcy. Related: Grieving parents receive student loan relief But for many parents, getting their child a good college education is non-negotiable -- and that's when life insurance can provide a little peace of mind, says Eleanor Blayney, a certified financial planner and consumer advocate for CFP Board. Jennifer Boughan, 47, purchased life insurance policies for her three daughters as soon as they enrolled in college. Each policy costs around $150 per year and provides $100,000 in coverage, enough to cover each girl's $50,000 to $60,000 in private and federal student loans should something happen. "These policies are in case -- and God forbid -- the worst that could happen, does," said Boughan. "Seems to me that is a far better expense than to have to face the devastation of what comes after the tragedy of a lost child." Related: 3 things that drive life insurance premiums through the roof After hearing about the financial blow some grieving families have faced, Joseph Barbano took out an insurance policy for his college-bound son. Barbano hasn't had to take out loans yet, but he thinks he may need to down the road and wants to protect himself just in case. The 20-year term policy he took out for his son costs less than $20 per month and provides $250,000 in coverage. Shopping for life insurance Before purchasing a life insurance policy for your child, check with your lender. Some private lenders have recently started providing relief when a primary borrower dies -- including lending giants Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo and Discover. In these cases, insurance is generally unnecessary, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors. If your lender doesn't offer any protections, then compare insurance quotes online to find the best life insurance plan. Websites like InsuranceQuotes.com, which aggregates information from hundreds of top-rated insurers, can help you comparison shop. You'll want to look for a term life insurance policy, which is a temporary policy where you can choose the length of coverage -- say 10 or 20 years. The coverage you get should be equal to the loan balance -- $100,000 in coverage for $100,000 in loans, for example -- and the loan term should be equal to the estimated repayment term of the loan, Kantrowitz recommends.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140731153947-elizabeth-warren-cnnmoney-story-student-loan-forgiveness-00020025-1024x576.jpg

But just how much does your age, gender or smoking habit cost you? InsuranceQuotes.com evaluated life insurance premiums for the top 25 carriers in the nation to find out. Men pay an average of 38% more than women for the same coverage. Here's one area where women have a financial edge. Men are at a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, various cancers and accidental injuries and that makes them more risky to insurers. The average life expectancy of an American man is also five years younger than a woman's, meaning an insurer is more likely to pay out on a man's policy than a woman's. Smokers pay more than three times as much as non-smokers for the same policy. Insurers can charge smokers three times as much as non-smokers, insuranceQuotes.com found. Related: Stressful jobs that pay badly A non-smoking 45-year-old woman, for example, pays $45 a month for a $500,000 term life policy. If she smokes, however, the premium shoots up to $167 a month. That's $1,462 more a year. If you can kick the habit, however, you can save big. Tell your insurer that you've been smoke-free for two years and they will usually lower your premium to the rate for non-smokers, said Laura Adams, an analyst for insuranceQuotes.com. "That's pretty generous," said Adams. "It's almost like you never smoked." Related: Why you don't need to buy extra rental car insurance But don't tell your insurer that if it's not true. If you do die of a smoking-related cause and your insurer finds out you never quit, they can deny the benefit entirely. Get coverage young and save -- but only if you need it Most people don't feel the need to buy life insurance until they have a child. And in general, that's a pretty good rule of thumb. If you have children in your 20s or early 30s you could save significantly on premiums by opening a policy while you're young. Premiums for 35 year olds cost about 27% more than those for a 25 year old. "Term life [policies are] popular because they're relatively inexpensive and people don't need policies for their entire life," said Adams.

Wall is one of the 4.7 million Americans closely watching dueling court decisions released Tuesday on whether the government can subsidize premiums for people who bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

Americans like him are anxiously waiting to see how it all plays out in court. Anything could happen.

A second ruling okayed the subsidies. Wall has been wary of the controversial politics around Obamacare, which is why he decided to wait to get his subsidy when he files his 2014 taxes next year. "I didn't want any uncertainty," said Wall, 59, of Atlanta. "I didn't want to have to worry about paying the government back." Related: Split decisions on Obamacare Obamacare has been a boon for Wall, who retired in late 2012 after nearly 40 years in the airline industry, primarily at Delta Airlines. Decades of loading freight and passengers on airplanes in the early morning hours was stressful work and Wall wanted to retire early without worrying about healthcare expenses. Wall deals with minor health issues, including complications from surgery on a torn leg tendon. Related: I'm quitting my job. Thanks, Obamacare!

http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/15/news/economy/obamacare-help/index.html?section=money_pf_insurance|Obamacare help was in high demand|Signing up for Obamacare was anything but easy. It wasn't as simple as filling out a few forms. People who signed up for the Affordable Care Act insurance found they had to answer questions about income, taxes, family size and immigration status. There were also multiple choices available for plans that were not very different from each other. But, guess what? People reached out for help. During the enrollment period, about 10.6 million people received personal help from navigators and other enrollment assisters, according to a report released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The assistance was time consuming: 64% of the programs reported spending an hour to two hours with each consumer on average. Funded by federal and state governments as well as outside sources, there were about 28,000 individual assisters and navigators across the country, the survey found. Almost 90% of assister programs surveyed reported that most or nearly all of the people they helped were uninsured. Related: 8 million sign up for Obamacare Assistance was not distributed equally across states. People in states running their own healthcare exchange were twice as likely to receive help with enrollment. Those 16 states had about twice as many assisters per 10,000 uninsured Americans compared to the 29 states that defaulted to a federally-facilitated exchange. The discrepancy is not terribly surprising: the states running their own exchanges had significantly more funding available for outreach and enrollment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services awarded a much smaller $67 million in federal grants to fund navigator programs in the 34 states with federally-facilitated or partnership exchanges. Related: Were Obamacare applications accurate? Who knows? In addition, the mostly Republican states that defaulted to the federal exchange tend to have higher rates of individuals without insurance. Some 33% of the nation's uninsured population lives in states running their own exchanges, while 68% live in states that defaulted to the federal exchange or set up a partnership. In the end, it wasn't the broken website that was the main reason people sought help -- it was a lack of understanding of how Affordable Care worked. More than 85% said that most or nearly all had a limited understanding of the new healthcare law, and needed help understanding their plan choices. Related: Uninsured rate plummets under Obamacare Three out of four said that most or nearly all needed help understanding basic health insurance terms. "How can you explain coverage options to someone who doesn't know what a deductible is?" said Karen Pollitz, lead author of the survey. "It's just a much longer conversation." The need for help selecting the right plan is not likely to disappear in the coming years. Some consumers are starting to come back with post-enrollment problems, Pollitz said. "It's a fundamental need people are probably going to have for the foreseeable future," she said, especially as consumers experience a change in family size or employment.

An analysis of storm surges found that 6.5 million single family coastal homes are at risk from flooding during this year's hurricane season, according to property researcher CoreLogic. Given that oceanfront homes are among the most valuable properties along the coasts and also in the front line of incoming storms, the costs related to such flooding are also high. Floods from storm surges represent a collective $1.5 trillion in potential reconstruction costs, CoreLogic said.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/pf/taxes/tax-cuts-temporary/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Enjoy your tax cuts while they last|First, the good news. A lot of households under the GOP tax plan, which President Trump is set to sign into law this week, will see a lower tax bill in the next several years. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2019, more than half of filers making $40,000 and up will see an average tax cut greater than $500. That trend holds for income groups over $50,000 in the subsequent years measured through 2025. The Tax Institute at H&R Block provided some scenarios of people with young children, for instance, who could see their tax burden drop by roughly $2,000 or more next year. But here's the thing: After 2025, all individual tax cuts are set to expire. At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. As a result, by 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase relative to what they pay today, the JCT estimates. Related: Try the CNN tax calculator to see how you may fare under GOP bill Republicans made individual tax cuts temporary so they could meet budget rules that let them pass their tax overhaul with no Democratic votes. But don't worry, they say. A future Congress won't let middle class tax cuts expire. Recent precedents -- like the oft-extended Bush tax cuts -- suggest they may be right. Still, there's zero guarantee of that. After all, a lot can change over eight years. In any case, there's another reason you could end up with a tax increase after 2025. While the cuts are temporary, the GOP tax bill makes permanent another key provision that tax expert Lily Batchelder has described as a "stealth tax increase" for individuals, the effects of which will grow over time. The money it will raise is a big reason why the cost of the permanent corporate tax cuts will be paid for in the second decade, according to Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University. Related: What's in the final GOP tax plan The GOP plan introduces a new, slower inflation measure called chained CPI that will apply to inflation-adjusted parts of the tax code. So, for example, the income ranges that apply to each of the seven income tax rates will grow more slowly. So will the value of many tax credits and the income phaseout thresholds for various tax breaks. Those thresholds dictate whether you make too much money to qualify for certain breaks. The upshot for tax filers is this: Many tax breaks, Batchelder said, "will be worth less over time than they are under current law. And people will gradually be pushed into higher tax brackets over time."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171220134046-capitol-hill-tax-reform-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/pf/taxes/tax-bill-effects-2018/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|How much you'd pay under GOP tax plan depends on a million things|President Trump has hailed the GOP tax plan as a "giant tax cut" for the middle class. While many people will pay less tax in the next few years, just how much less will vary greatly. Plus, some individuals will end up paying even more. How do you know where you'll fall? Just like under today's code, many factors will determine what your tax burden will be. Your marital status, how many kids you have, how you make a living, where you live, which tax breaks you ordinarily take, plus other elements will affect the changes you'd see in your tax bill if the GOP plan becomes law. The Tax Institute at H&R Block ran a number of scenarios for filers in different situations to give a more specific gauge of where you might stand in 2018 if you're a wage earner. In the next several years, plenty of filers are likely to see a tax cut of some kind, although not everyone will be quite so lucky. But t he story will change as the decade rolls on because individual tax cuts would expire after 2025. Related: What's in the GOP's final tax plan Here's just a sampling of how people in different situations may fare next year. Keep in mind, these scenarios do not delve into the more complex provisions of the Republican plan that, for instance, taxes a filer's business income at a lower rate than their wage income. Much more needs to be unpacked by experts as to how that will play out for different filers. Nor do they take into account the potential effects of other provisions in the tax bill -- such as eliminating the penalty for not buying health insurance -- or any future spending cuts that may be made to help offset the cost of the tax bill. Family of four in San Diego, Calif. -- $150,000 income -- Married couple with two children under 17 -- Homeowners -- Itemized deductions today total $22,000 ($7,000 state/local income tax; $5,000 property tax; $8,000 mortgage interest; $2,000 charitable contributions) The family would save an estimated $3,559 in federal income taxes: They would no longer itemize, opting instead to take the nearly doubled $24,000 standard deduction for joint filers. Their top tax rate would drop to 22% from 25% today. And they would become newly eligible to take the expanded Child Tax Credit ($2,000 per child). Related: See new tax brackets for 2018 under today's law vs. GOP tax plan The Tax Institute ran another example of a married couple in Houston -- with three kids under 17 -- also making $150,000 and found they'd save a little more ($3,771) on their tax bill for the same reasons. Head of household in Kansas City, Mo. -- $45,000 income -- Single parent with two children under 17 -- Renter -- Takes standard deduction today of $9,550 The family would save an estimated $1,802 in federal income taxes: The standard deduction for heads of households nearly doubles to $18,000. The family's top tax rate of 15% falls to 12%. And the child tax credit is doubled to $2,000 per child. The Tax Institute ran another scenario of a single parent with three kids under 17 in Los Angeles making $75,000. That family would save $2,560 for the same reasons. Single person in Queens, N.Y. -- $120,000 income -- No kids -- Homeowner (co-op) -- Itemized deductions totaling $22,500 ($10,000 state/local income tax; $5,000 property tax; $6,000 mortgage interest; $1,500 charitable contributions) The person would save an estimated $101 in federal income taxes: While her top income tax rate would drop to 24% from 28%, the GOP bill caps her state and local tax deduction (income + property) at $10,000, which is $5,000 less than she currently takes. She would still continue to itemize under the bill because even with the $10,000 cap, her deductions combined would exceed the nearly doubled standard deduction of $12,000 for single filers. Single person in Westminster, Colo. -- $70,000 income -- No kids -- Homeowner --$10,000 in unreimbursed business expenses -- Itemized deductions totaling $19,600 ($2,500 state and local income tax; $3,500 property taxes; $5,000 in mortgage interest deduction; $8,600 in unreimbursed employee business expenses, since filers are only allowed to deduct those expenses in excess of 2% of AGI). The person would pay an estimated $1,484 more in federal income taxes: Even though this filer's top tax rate falls to 22% from 25% currently, he would no longer be able to deduct any unreimbursed business expenses under the GOP bill, so he would end up taking the $12,000 standard deduction instead of itemizing. Single person in New York City -- $500,000 income -- No kids -- Homeowner -- Itemized deductions totaling $135,000 ($46,000 state/local tax; $24,000 property tax; $55,000 mortgage interest; $10,000 charitable contributions) but capped at $128,001 due to a limitation in the current code for high earners. The person would pay an estimated $6,470 more in federal income taxes: The reason is two-fold. First, the filer's top tax rate rises to 35% under the GOP bill, up from 28% today. And second, his state and local tax deduction is limited to $10,000, down from the $70,000 he takes currently.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171101141033-capitol-building-twilight-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/17/pf/taxes/gop-tax-plan-simplify/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|New tax code will still be complicated despite GOP promise to simplify|President Trump said H&R Block would go out of business because his tax overhaul would be so simple. But the plan Republicans and Trump came up with almost certainly won't put tax preparers out of business. The final tax bill, released on Friday, does indeed deliver some simplification, but not as much as promised. And it adds plenty of complications, particularly for small businesses. Republicans have said that under their tax plan your tax return could be filed on a postcard. That seems unlikely. But even if the IRS shrinks the 1040 you'd still need to check a bundle of instructions to fill it out. The plan does get points for simplification, experts say, by nearly doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for joint filers. Doing that would drastically reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize since the only reason to do so is if all your deductions exceed the standard deduction. To itemize, you have to keep lots of records to track eligible expenses, and then figure out if your income or other factors limit how much of a deduction you can take. Related: Here's what's in the GOP's final tax plan All in, roughly 30 million households that itemize today are likely to take the nearly doubled standard deduction instead. "[It] should simplify tax record-keeping and reporting. Taxpayers might not immediately notice this, but over time they should adjust their behavior," said Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center. But of those 30 million, many "will still have to do the computations to see if they will itemize or take the standard deduction," said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts. Related: Changes to the child tax credit - What it means for families Of course, deductions aren't the only tax breaks with eligibility rules, income phaseouts and other mind-bending limitations. The GOP tax plan keeps, and in some cases expands, several tax credits. And just as under today's code, the rules for them aren't intuitive. The ins-and-outs of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, for instance, are complex and will remain so. Even if taxes were easy enough to file on a postcard, every line item on it would have pages of instructions and forms backing up the number you report, said Kathy Pickering, executive director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block. And let's not forget the fact that the tax bill preserves the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. Yes, it reduces the number of people who would be hit by it by raising income exemption levels. But people will still have to figure out if they're on the hit list. That requires calculating your tax burden twice -- once under one set of rules, and once under a different set of rules -- and pay whichever is highest. Related: What's in the tax bill for homeowners Lastly, experts worry that the GOP tax plan actually would make tax filing a more complex experience for people who have business income from so-called pass-through entities, which are not taxed under the corporate code. Those include businesses and investment funds set up as sole proprietorships, partnerships and limited liability corporations. The owners, partners and shareholders pay the pass-through's taxes on their individual returns. Under the GOP tax bill, wages, pass-through business income, and corporate profits would be taxed at very different rates, whereas today wages and pass-through income are subject to the same rates. And the bill imposes a complicated calculation to determine how much of a pass-through business owner's income may be taxed at the lower business rate and how much at the higher wage rate. "The pass-through rules are really complicated," Mazur of the Tax Policy Center says. "And I expect taxpayers and their advisers will try hard to find ways to exploit [them]."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/131218140518-1040-tax-form-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/05/pf/taxes/tax-reform-amt-research-innovation/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|How tax reform could hinder innovation in the U.S.|In its frenzied rush to write a tax bill that could win enough votes, the Senate inadvertently weakened a powerful tool for promoting innovation. The research and development tax credit allows companies to write off a portion of their spending on experimentation for new and better products. It's been particularly popular with drug companies and the software industry since first being enacted in 1981. After the credit was made permanent in 2015, the Treasury Department estimated it would cost $148 billion between 2017 and 2026, making it one of the largest tax breaks in the revenue code. The credit survived in both the House and the Senate tax bills, which eliminated several tax breaks in order to justify lowering the corporate tax rate to 20%. And it would have continued to help corporations lower their taxes even further, but for a last-minute decision by the Senate to keep the alternative minimum tax (AMT) instead of repealing it, as conservatives have long sought. The AMT serves as a backstop that prevents corporations from taking so many credits and deductions that they pay no tax at all. Currently, companies calculate their "regular" corporate tax rate — which tops out at 35%, minus any exemptions — and pay either that or a 20% rate on an "alternative" income formulation, whichever is higher. The Treasury's most recent published analysis of the corporate AMT, from 2002, found that it applied to only about 13,000 businesses. The AMT was repealed in the House's version. But when the bill finally passed the Senate in the early hours of Saturday morning, the AMT remained in place. If it's not removed, that could render the R&D credit moot, since more companies will have to pay a minimum tax under the AMT that can't be lowered further by most credits or deductions. Related: 13 ways the tax bills would affect people "With the current proposed changes, there's going to be more middle market companies that are going to be subject to the AMT, and would lose the ability to get R&D credits," says Charles Goulding, CEO of a Long Island-based tax consultancy that specializes in research credits. The snafu highlights the challenge of balancing a drive to lower overall rates with the desire to use the tax code as a carrot that rewards socially and economically beneficial behavior, like investing in research. When companies aren't paying much in taxes in the first place, it's more difficult to offer them incentives. Of course, companies would still get a very large tax cut, freeing up money that could be used for research and development. But studies suggest that making it cheaper to invest in research than pay out larger dividends to shareholders, for example, leads them to innovate more than they might otherwise. The R&D situation is less of a problem for small companies — those making less than $50 million in the past three years can still apply the R&D tax credit against the AMT. Currently, 73% of businesses who claim the R&D tax credit fall under the $50 million threshold, according to the U.S. Treasury. But it's still a problem for large companies, like Google (GOOG) and Intel (INTC), which account for the vast majority of the value of the credits. Caught off guard, they mobilized over the weekend to try to get the AMT taken out of the final bill. "Retaining the AMT in reform is even more harmful than it is in its present form," wrote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a blog post on Monday morning. "This cannot be the intended impact from a Congress who has worked for years to enact a more globally competitive tax code." Related: Here's what's in the Senate tax bill The AMT dust up isn't the only way in which tax reform could hurt scientific research, however. The House and Senate bills also require research expenses to be amortized over several years, rather than deducted immediately, which draws out the benefit for those who claim the credit. "While it is true that to some extent this is a timing issue, it is in fact a significant detriment to small companies who need the money sooner," says Steven Miller, national director of tax at the consultancy Alliantgroup. Tax reform could have repercussions for publicly funded research as well. Federal science funding has been declining as a share of GDP since the 1970s, and took a particularly hard hit during the recession. President Trump's proposed "skinny budget" from the spring, which didn't go anywhere, would have further slashed budgets for research supported by the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. Adding $1 trillion to the deficit won't brighten the picture for federal science funding, says Joe Kennedy, a fellow with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a D.C.-based think tank that has pushed for the R&D tax credit to be expanded. "I think a much much better bill could've been passed," Kennedy said. "Corporate reform is so important. But is it worth introducing all these other flaws?"|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171204171808-rd-tax-reform-780x439.jpg

It depends on who you ask. Some business, advocacy and trade groups have major concerns with it. Others say the tax plan will be boost the economy. The plan isn't law yet. Another round of votes is due in the coming days. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have vowed to get it to President Trump for his signature by Christmas. Here's a breakdown of some responses, pro and con. The statements have been condensed in some cases for brevity. It will leave millions uninsured The bill rolls back a key provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast that 13 million fewer people would have health insurance coverage by 2027, and premiums would rise by about 10% in most years. Families USA: "Republican leadership in the House and Senate have come up with a deal that will increase health insurance premiums, making millions of people -- including those with pre-existing conditions like cancer or diabetes -- pay more for their coverage, while causing millions more to lose their health coverage altogether. All of that to fund permanent tax cuts for their wealthy donors and corporations." -- Families USA Executive Director Frederick Isasi Families USA is a left-leaning advocacy group that works on behalf of health care consumers. Its lower corporate tax rates will boost the economy The bill slices the corporate rate to 21% from 35% and lowers the tax burden for pass-through businesses, such as LLCs and partnerships. Business Roundtable: "Business leaders applaud the conference committee for coming to an agreement that will promote U.S. competitiveness and spur economic growth." --Business Roundtable statement Business Roundtable is an association of CEOs from some of America's largest corporations. American Bankers Association: "ABA believes the significant reforms included in this legislation will help grow the economy and create jobs. We particularly applaud the provisions that significantly lower tax rates for all types of businesses beginning in 2018. Banks currently have one of the highest effective tax rates of any industry, and these important changes will allow our members to better serve their customers and the broader economy." --ABA president and CEO Rob Nichols ABA represents small, midsize, regional and large banks. Americans for Prosperity: "This final tax reform plan delivers relief to the working class while unleashing opportunity and growth for America's small business owners and job creators. ... Although not perfect, the House and the Senate should be commended for their diligent work to significantly improve our broken system, and the Trump White House deserves credit for its relentless focus on getting tax reform done this year. --AFP President Tim Phillips. AFP is a conservative advocacy group. Financial Services Roundtable: "Tax reform will help deliver expanded opportunity for individuals and American businesses of all sizes. Congress should quickly move tax reform over the finish line and enable America to go on economic offense." --Financial Services Roundtable CEO Tim Pawlenty Financial Services Roundtable is an advocacy group that represents banks and credit card companies. It will be bad for homeowners The bill lowers the cap on mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $750,000, and it eliminates the deduction for interest on home equity loans. Homeowners who already have a mortgage would be unaffected by the change. California Association of Realtors: "The final tax reform bill released punishes homeowners and weakens homeownership. ... Congress is touting this as a tax cut for middle-class families, but the reality is that thousands of California middle-class homeowners will be the first ones to face tax increases." --CAR President Steve White CAR is a trade group that represents 190,000 California brokers and other real estate professionals. It will hurt states and cities The bill will preserve the state and local tax deductions for anyone who itemizes, but it will cap the amount at $10,000. National League of Cities: "Congress can't pay for tax reform by stripping the tools that help build stronger, healthier and more economically vibrant communities. [The bill] preserves many key credits and partially protects the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). Unfortunately, the final bill falls short on its promise to protect American families and the cities and towns in which they live." --NLC President Mark Stodola, mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas NLC is an advocacy group that works on behalf of 19,000 American cities and towns. It will gut charitable giving The tax bill roughly doubles the standard deduction. Taxpayers can only claim deductions for their charitable donations if they itemize. Nonprofits argue the higher standard deduction will abolish a key giving incentive. National Council of Nonprofits: "The deal ... will prove disastrous to the work of charitable nonprofits in communities across America. ... If enacted, the bill would, among other things: damage charitable giving by $13 billion or more annually; destroy more than 220,000 nonprofit jobs; and impair the ability of nonprofits to address community needs. ... Simplifying the tax code could have been a noble exercise, but this bill would do much more harm than good." --National Council of Nonprofits President and CEO Tim Delaney National Council of Nonprofits is an advocacy group that works on behalf of charitable nonprofits in the United States. It will harm small businesses The bill establishes new rules for businesses that file taxes on their individual returns, known as pass-throughs. Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform: "The proposals also do little to simplify the code, and actually make it more complex for the more than 90% of small businesses that organize their firms as pass-through entities. This means [small business] owners will continue to sink time and money into complying with a byzantine and bewildering tax code, further tilting the playing field in favor of large corporations that can afford armies of accountants to search out every loophole and advantage. ... A ballooning deficit is bad for business because it drives interest rates higher. --Letter to Congress from Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform, signed by nearly 2,000 entrepreneurs Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform is an advocacy coalition that works on behalf of small business owners. It will help the economy but add to federal debt The bill, while lowering corporate taxes, would increase deficits by an estimated $1.46 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. American Enterprise Institute: "The bill features a long overdue reduction in the corporate tax rate that will draw investment to the United States, boosting workers' productivity and wages. However, the bill will also increase government debt, threatening to drive up interest rates and counteract the increase in investment. A plan to address the long-run fiscal imbalance has become even more imperative." --AEI Resident Scholar Alan D.

The legislation was unveiled Friday, and lawmakers in both the House and Senate are set to vote next week. Here is what the bill will and won't do for your education expenses. Student loan interest deduction saved You will still be allowed to claim a deduction of up to $2,500 for the interest you pay on your student loans each year. About 12 million people benefited from this tax break in 2015. It can be claimed without itemizing your taxes, but it's only available to certain borrowers, depending on their income. The benefit is gradually reduced once your modified adjusted gross income reaches $65,000 for singles, or $135,000 for couples, and completely phased out for singles who earn more than $80,000, and couples who earn $165,000. The deduction can save taxpayers as much as $625 a year, though most see a smaller benefit. Graduate student tuition waiver tax spared The bill spares graduate students from having to pay income tax on tuition waivers -- something that was proposed in the House version of the bill. The measure was protested by graduate students across the country who worried it would increase their tax bills by thousands of dollars. An estimated 145,000 graduate students who teach or do research for their university receive tuition waivers from the school. Related: Will Obamacare survive the tax bill? Employer tuition reimbursement is still tax-free Employers can give workers up to $5,250 tax-free to help pay for tuition, and the award will remain tax-free under the bill. About half of employers offer the benefit, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. How do you think tax reform will affect you?

Currently, money invested in a 529 account grows tax-free but can only be used for college expenses. Under the new bill, up to $10,000 can be distributed annually to pay for the cost of sending a child to a "public, private or religious elementary or secondary school." The money could also be used for some expenses connected with a homeschool, the bill says. The changes would apply to distributions made after December 31, 2017. Death and disability loan forgiveness tax repealed The bill excludes student debt forgiveness from taxable income for the borrower if they become permanently disabled. It also excludes forgiveness in the event of death if there is a co-signer on the loan. It will apply to federal and state student loans discharged after December 31, 2017 -- but will not apply to any after December 21, 2025. American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning credits remain untouched Despite proposed changes to these credits in an earlier House bill, both the American Opportunity Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit will remain the same. The AOC is worth up to $2,500 per student for each of the first four years of college. An earlier House bill would have expanded the benefit to a fifth year, but that provision was omitted in the final version. The credit is gradually reduced once your modified adjusted gross income reaches $80,000 for singles, or $160,000 for couples, and completely phased out for singles who earn more than $90,000, and couples who earn $180,000. The earlier House version would have scrapped the LLC, but it will live on under the final bill. It's a smaller benefit, worth up to $2,000, and is available to people under a lower income cap. But it can be claimed for each year you're enrolled in college.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171215165043-tax-bill-higher-education-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/15/pf/taxes/tax-bill-teacher-supplies-deduction/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies survives|It's better than nothing. Lawmakers have decided not to touch a tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on school supplies -- effectively splitting the difference between competing proposals. Currently, teachers can deduct up to $250 for classroom materials from their taxable income. It applies to both those who take the standard deduction, and to those who itemize. That deduction won't change if the House and Senate pass their compromise tax bill in its current form. Votes are expected next week. Last month, the House passed a bill that would have eliminated the deduction. The Senate bill, meanwhile, would have doubled it to $500. The tax break for educators helps offset the hundreds of dollars many teachers spend out-of-pocket each school year for supplies like paper, scissors and posters. Teachers surveyed by education publishing company Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 in the past year. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. Related: Grad students have been spared under the GOP tax plan Sonia Smith, president of the Chesterfield Education Association in Virginia, said increasing the deduction to $500 would have been helpful. "That's closer to what most of my colleagues spend," said Smith, who is a high school English teacher. "And I can tell you for an elementary school teacher, it's far more." Smith said teachers have to spend their own money to decorate their classrooms, and to buy standard items like pencils, pens and highlighters. Related: Will Obamacare survive the tax cut? The deduction's burden on the federal budget is limited. According to the Treasury Department, the deduction cut federal tax revenue by an estimated $200 million in the 2017 fiscal year. Despite the tax break's survival, the National Education Association maintains its opposition to the bill. "Clearly, Congress heard the outcry from educators and parents when House Republicans tried to eliminate the $250 deduction for school supplies," Lily Eskelsen García, the group's president, said in a statement. "But the overall GOP tax bill is full of giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. It's outrageous that working families will now have to pay that bill."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171215174228-teacher-tax-bill-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/04/pf/taxes/undocumented-immigrants-tax-bill/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|How the GOP tax bills hurt undocumented immigrants|The tax bills passed by the House and the now the Senate include slightly more generous benefits for parents. Unless their children are undocumented immigrants. Currently, non-citizens filing taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, are allowed to claim the child tax credit, which gives back up to $1,000 per child under age 17. In tax year 2013, according to the Government Accountability Office, 4.4 million ITIN filers claimed child tax credits worth $6 billion. Under both the House and Senate versions of the Republican tax bill, ITIN filers — most of whom are undocumented — would need to provide Social Security numbers for each child in order to claim the refundable part of the credit, which kicks in when the credit exceeds the filer's total tax liability. The Senate version would require an Social Security number for the regular credit as well. According to Samantha Vargas Poppe of the Latino advocacy group UnidosUS, the change would directly impact about a million undocumented children. But it could also hurt those born in the United States whose non-citizen siblings are no longer eligible for the credit. That income hit would impact the whole family. Related: Here's what's in the Senate's tax bill -- and how it differs from the House's "These credits keep folks out of poverty," Poppe says. "It's just not a place for immigration enforcement. These are kids." Undocumented immigrants and their employers paid about $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010, the most recent year for which the Social Security Administration has released figures. Many also pay Social Security taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes, but are not eligible for most federal programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid or subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. For U.S. citizens, the House bill increases the value of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600. The Senate bill doubles it to $2,000. Both bills increase the income threshold at which taxpayers will be eligible to claim it. In addition, the House bill tightens up the rules for the Earned Income Tax Credit in such a way that immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will no longer be able to receive the credit when their work authorization expires. The Trump administration announced in September its decision to terminate the program, which means those immigrants will lose their protected status over the next few years unless Congress intervenes. The House bill would also require a Social Security number for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is worth $2,500 annually towards the first four years of higher education expenses. In 2013, ITIN filers claimed $204 million through this credit. The Senate bill makes no changes to these credits. Related: 13 ways the tax bills would affect people Conservatives have long sought these restrictions, which they say are necessary to guard against tax fraud. The anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies has also argued that allowing undocumented immigrants to receive refundable tax credits violates provisions of the welfare reforms of 1996 that prohibit undocumented immigrants from receiving most federal benefits. Luke Messer, a Republican representative for Indiana, introduced legislation that would have eliminated child tax credit eligibility for ITIN filers earlier this year. "We can't continue to reward people who come to our country illegally, while those who work hard and play by the rules struggle to get ahead," he said in a press release in October pushing for the bill's inclusion in tax reform measures. Democrats and a long list of immigrants rights advocacy groups have opposed carving undocumented children out of the child tax credit, saying it will increase child poverty.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/03/pf/taxes/senate-house-tax-bills-individuals/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Senate and House differ on key points|The tax overhaul bills passed by the Senate and House would likely to change your tax return in ways large and small -- which credits you can take, what you can deduct, how much you pay. But they differ on key points. You'll be hearing a lot about those differences in the days ahead. The Senate and House must reconcile the two bills into one, which would then go before each chamber for a final vote. Here's a look at some of the notable ways they diverge in how they treat individual tax filers. 1. When the individual provisions expire Senate: Most expire in 2025. House: Most are permanent. 2. The mandate to buy health insurance Senate: Eliminates it by reducing the penalty to $0. House: Preserves it. 3. Tax brackets and rates Senate: Keeps seven tax brackets but changes, and -- in most instances -- lowers the rates. The new rates would be: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 38.5%. House: Calls for four brackets: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%. 4. Standard deduction Senate: Raises it to $12,000 from $6,350 for single filers; to $18,000 from $9,350 for heads of household; to $24,000 from $12,700 for joint filers. House: Raises it to $12,200 for single filers; to $18,300 for heads of household; to $24,400 for joint filers. 5. Child tax credit Senate: Increases it to $2,000 from $1,000, but the additional $1,000 would not be refundable -- meaning many low- and middle-income tax filers likely wouldn't receive the increased portion of the credit. Allows it for children under 18, up from 17 today, but only until 2025. Makes the full credit available to higher income families. House: Increases it to $1,600 from $1,000, but the additional $600 would not be refundable. Makes it available to higher income families. 6. New family credit Senate: Creates a temporary $500 credit for dependents who aren't children. House: Creates temporary $300 personal credit for parents and their non-child dependents. 7. Mortgage interest deduction Senate: Keeps it as is. House: Lowers the amount of mortgage debt on which interest may be deducted to $500,000 from $1 million. 8. Medical expense deduction Senate: Keeps it in place and temporarily lowers the adjusted gross income threshold that must be met to qualify for it. Today you may deduct medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income -- that would be lowered to 7.5%. House: Eliminates it. 9. Teachers' deduction for school supplies Senate: Doubles it to $500 from $250. House: Eliminates it. 10. Graduate student tuition waiver Senate: Keeps it in place. House: Eliminates it. 11. Student loan interest deduction Senate: Keeps it in place. House: Eliminates it. 12. Alternative Minimum Tax Senate: Keeps it but raises amount of money exempt from it through 2025. Then income exemption levels revert to present law. House: Repeals it. 13. Estate tax Senate: Shields more people from it by doubling the exemption levels to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples. House: Doubles the exemption levels for six years then repeals the estate tax in 2024.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171203154131-capitol-hill-selfie-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/02/pf/taxes/senate-tax-bill-passed/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Here's what's in the Senate tax bill|Republicans crossed another major hurdle in their effort to get a tax bill to President Trump's desk by Christmas. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Senate passed a sweeping tax overhaul bill in largely party-line vote. Just one Republican, Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, voted against it on deficit concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cost $1.47 trillion over a decade. Many Republicans continue to say the bill will pay for itself through greater economic growth, despite all analyses to the contrary. The final Senate bill differs from the tax bill passed by the House in mid-November. Those differences now must be reconciled and a final piece of legislation voted on by both chambers. Stay tuned for that. Meantime, here are key ways the Senate bill would affect individuals and businesses, and how it differs from the House legislation. FOR INDIVIDUALS Changes individual income tax brackets: There are seven brackets in today's individual tax code: 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%. The Senate bill also calls for seven brackets but changes the rates on taxable income to: - 10% (income up to $9,525 for individuals; up to $19,050 for married couples filing jointly) - 12% (over $9,525 to $38,700; over $19,050 to $77,400 for couples) - 22% (over $38,700 to $70,000; over $77,400 to $140,000 for couples) - 24% (over $70,000 to $160,000; over $140,000 to $320,000 for couples) - 32% (over $160,000 to $200,000; over $320,000 to $400,000 for couples) - 35% (over $200,000 to $500,000; over $400,000 to $1 million for couples - 38.5% (over $500,000; over $1 million for couples) The House bill, by contrast, only calls for four brackets: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%. Nearly doubles the standard deduction: The House and Senate bills nearly double the standard deduction. For single filers the Senate bill increases it to $12,000 from $6,350 currently; and it raises it for married couples filing jointly to $24,000 from $12,700. That would drastically reduce the number of people who opt to itemize their deductions, since the only reason to do so is if your individual deductions combined exceed the standard deduction amount. Eliminates personal exemptions: Today you're allowed to claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, your spouse and each of your dependents. Both the Senate and House bills eliminate that option. Related: Even with growth, the Senate tax bill still adds $1 trillion to deficits For families with three or more kids, that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might enjoy as a result of other provisions in the bill. Kills state and local income tax deduction, limits property tax break: Today itemizers may deduct their property taxes as well as their state and local income or sales taxes. The original Senate bill called for a full repeal of the SALT deduction. But it was amended to preserve an itemized deduction for property taxes but only up to $10,000, which is identical to the House measure. Expands the child tax credit: The Senate GOP bill increases the child tax credit to $2,000 per child, up from $1,000 today, and above the $1,600 proposed in the House bill. Senate GOP tax writers would make the credit available for any children under 18, up from today's under-17 age limit. But it reverts to under 17 again in 2025, a year before the increase is set to expire under the bill. But the $1,000 increase won't be available to the lowest income families if they don't end up owing federal income taxes. That's because unlike the first $1,000, the additional $1,000 wouldn't be refundable. When a credit is refundable, it means you still can get money from the government because of the credit, even when your federal income tax bill is zero. The Senate bill also greatly expands who is eligible for the credit by raising the roof on the income thresholds where the credit starts to phase out: To $500,000 for married tax filers, up from $110,000 today. Meanwhile, filers with dependents who are not qualified children may be able to claim a new $500 nonrefundable credit per dependent. Under the House bill, there would be a new $300 per person credit for parents and dependents over 17. Keeps mortgage interest deduction as is: The Senate bill would still let you claim a deduction for the interest you pay on mortgage debt up to $1 million. The House wants to cap the loan limit at $500,000 for new mortgages. Since the House and Senate bills sharply increase the standard deduction, the percent of filers who claim the mortgage deduction would drop sharply. The Senate bill does make two changes on home-related financing. It disallows interest deductions for home equity loans. And it lengthens the time you must live in a home to get the full tax-free exclusion on your gains when you sell it. Preserves the Alternative Minimum Tax: The original Senate bill, like the House-passed bill, would repeal the AMT. But to help offset the cost of other late amendments, the final revision of the Senate bill now keeps the AMT in place but raises the amount of income exempt from it. The AMT, originally intended to ensure the richest tax filers pay at least some tax by disallowing many tax breaks, most typically hits filers making between $200,000 and $1 million today. Those who make more usually find they owe more tax under the regular income tax code, so must pay that tab instead. Preserves the estate tax, but exempts almost everybody: Unlike the House GOP bill, Senate Republicans have not proposed repealing the estate tax. But they are proposing to double the exemption levels -- which are currently set at $5.49 million for individuals, and $10.98 million for married couples. Even at today's levels, only 0.2% of all estates ever end up being subject to the estate tax. Increases teacher deduction: Teachers who buy their own supplies for the classroom may deduct up to $250 today. The Senate bill doubles that amount to $500. The House bill, by contrast, eliminates the deduction. Expands the medical expense deduction: Today itemizers may deduct their medical and dental expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income. While the House bill gets rid of that deduction, the Senate bill not only keeps it but temporarily lowers that 10% threshold to 7.5% for tax years 2017 and 2018. Repeals the individual mandate to buy health insurance: The repeal is intended as a way to offset the cost of the tax bill. It is estimated to save money because it would reduce how much the federal government spends on insurance subsidies, since the assumption is fewer people who qualify for subsidies would purchase insurance if they're not subject to a penalty. But policy experts also note it could raise premiums because more healthy people might decide to skip buying insurance. FOR BUSINESSES Cut the corporate rate ... in a year: Like the House bill, the Senate bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today. But the 20% rate would not take effect until 2019 under the Senate proposal. The delay would reduce the cost of the measure in the first 10 years. Make expensing rules more generous: Senate Republicans want to make it possible for businesses to immediately and fully expense new equipment for five years, then phases the provision out by 20 percentage points per year thereafter. A House provision limits it to five years. Lower taxes on pass-through business income: Most U.S. businesses are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations. That means their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them on their personal returns under ordinary income tax rates. Both the House and Senate bills lower taxes on the business portion of a filer's passthrough income. The House bill dropped the top income tax rate to 25% from 39.6%, while prohibiting anyone providing professional services (e.g., lawyers and accountants) from taking advantage of the lower rate. It also phases in a lower rate of 9% for businesses that earn less than $75,000. The Senate bill lowers taxes on filers in pass-throughs by letting them deduct 23% of their income, up from 17.4% originally. The 23% deduction would be prohibited for anyone in a service business -- except those with taxable incomes under $500,000 if married ($250,000 if single). Prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates. But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the Senate bill would automatically limit the deduction to half of the W-2 wages of the pass-through entity or its share to the individual taxpayer. The W-2 rule would not apply, however, if the filer's taxable income is under $500,000 if married, $250,000 if single. Change how U.S. multinationals are taxed: Today U.S. companies owe Uncle Sam tax on all their profits, regardless of where the income is earned. They're allowed to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money home. Many argue that this "worldwide" tax system puts American businesses at a disadvantage. That's because most foreign competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems, meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore. The Senate bill proposes changes to move the U.S. to a territorial system. It also includes a number of anti-abuse provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming the system. And it would require companies to pay a one-time low tax rate on their existing overseas profits -- 14.5% on cash assets and 7.5% on non-cash assets (e.g., equipment abroad in which profits were invested), slightly higher than the 14% and 7% rates in the House bill.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171101141033-capitol-building-twilight-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/27/pf/taxes/trump-carried-interest-tax-break/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Whatever happened to Trump's crackdown on 'the hedge fund guys?'|Donald Trump vowed during the campaign to get rid of a tax loophole used by some millionaire and billionaire investors to slash their bills. "The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they'll pay more," he said during a Republican debate sponsored by CNN in 2015. "I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think it's unfair." But the tax break, known as the "carried interest" provision, remains essentially intact in both the House and Senate tax bills now under consideration. Related: Here's what's in the tax reform bill the Republicans just passed Despite the popular impression that the carried interest provision is a break for hedge fund managers, it's really private equity managers and real estate managers who benefit from it. It lets them pay a lower rate of just 20% on investment profits that are paid to fund managers, instead of the standard rate of nearly 40% for anyone in the top tax bracket. Trump himself said that those benefiting from the break were "getting away with murder." "They pick a stock and all of sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes," he said. But so far there is only one change in the carried interest provision in either bill. The proposed tax reforms stipulate that in order to qualify for the lower rate, the investments must be held for three years instead of the current requirement of one. But anyone who benefits from the carried interest provision typically holds their investments for much longer than three years, said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Related: How tax reform could affect families paying for college "That's a travesty," he said. "It is a cosmetic change to make it seem like something is being done with carried interest when nothing is being done." The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which tracks the impact of legislation, estimates that the change would increase revenue by only $1.2 billion over the 10-year period from 2018 to 2027, or $120 million a year. The JCT estimate confirms that change in the law "on carried interest is a bad joke," tweeted University of San Diego law professor Victor Fleischer. He made the tongue in cheek suggestion of having just a few of the top private equity mangers pay the top rate of 39.6%. JCT estimate confirms that the Brady amendment on carried interest is a bad joke. Raises $1.2B over 10 years. $120 million a year.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/04/news/economy/tax-bill-medical-expense-deduction/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|House tax bill would scrap deduction for medical expenses|The tax bill unveiled by Republicans in the House on Thursday would not, as had been rumored, eliminate the tax penalty for failure to have health insurance. But it would eliminate a decades-old deduction for people with very high medical costs. The controversial bill is an effort by Republicans to revamp the nation's tax code and provide dramatic tax cuts for business and individuals. However, its future is not yet clear because Republicans, who control both the House and Senate, appear divided on key measures. The medical deduction, originally created in World War II, is available only to taxpayers whose expenses are above 10% of their adjusted gross income. Because of that threshold, and because it is available only to people who itemize their deductions, the medical expense deduction is not used by many people — an estimated 8.8 million claimed it on their 2015 taxes, according to the IRS. Related: What's in the House tax bill for people But those 8.8 million tax filers claimed an estimated $87 billion in deductions; meaning that those who do qualify for the deduction have very high out-of-pocket health costs. "For many people, this is a big deduction," said David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, which opposes the change. AARP has calculated that about three-quarters of those who claim the medical expense deduction are 50 or older, and more than 70% have annual incomes of $75,000 or below. Many of those expenses are for long-term care, which is typically not covered by health insurance. Long-term care can cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars a year. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who is a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, called the bill's elimination of the medical expense deduction "anti-senior." But defenders of the bill say the elimination of the deduction should not be seen in isolation. The House tax bill also proposes eliminating billions of dollars in corporate tax credits that have played a key role in the booming "orphan drug" industry. In an FAQ posted on the House Ways and Means Committee website, the bill's sponsors denied that the change would "be a financial burden." "Our bill lowers the tax rates and increases the standard deduction so people can immediately keep more of their paychecks -- instead of having to rely on a myriad of provisions that many will never use and others may use only once in their lifetime," the sponsors said. Getting rid of many current deductions "is being done to finance rate cuts and increase the standard deduction and child tax credit," said Nicole Kaeding, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation. So, for many tax filers, she said, "there will likely be offsetting tax cuts." On the other hand, those offsetting cuts almost by definition will not make up the difference for people with very large medical expenses, who are the only ones who qualify for the medical deduction. "That's why tax reform is hard," Kaeding said. Related: These powerful groups hate the GOP tax plan Strikingly absent from the bill -- for now -- is any reference to the elimination of the tax penalty for failure to have health insurance. The so-called individual mandate is one of the most unpopular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans failed to change or repeal earlier this year. Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, is continuing to push language to add to the bill that would eliminate the penalty. President Donald Trump has added his endorsement via Twitter: "Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts," he wrote Wednesday.

Many businesses don't want a cut|Britain plans to cut its corporate tax rate to 17% over the next three years. But many businesses say they're happy with the current 19%, thank you very much. Make no mistake: Business leaders want to reduce their total tax burden. But they're asking U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond to take another look at how that's best achieved when he presents his budget on Wednesday. The British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has called on the government to maintain its current 19% rate, but instead cut property taxes and other lump-sum payments demanded of business. "In trying to create a competitive business environment, the focus should be on reducing the burden of upfront business costs and taxes," said Suren Thiru, head of economics and business finance at the BCC. That would help startups and companies struggling to make a profit more than a cut in tax on their income. Consulting firms EY and Deloitte agree. The head of U.K. tax policy at Deloitte, Bill Dodwell, said there is "broad agreement" in the business community that providing targeted relief would be more beneficial than a lower corporate tax rate. Questions about the U.K. policy reflect a broader debate within developed economies about the virtues of a lower headline corporate tax rate. The average corporate tax rate across more than 30 countries monitored by the OECD has dropped by 7.5 percentage points since 2000 to below 25%. The rate in Ireland is now just 12.5%. But the devil is often in the details. In the United States, for example, Republicans are pushing to reduce the corporate rate to 20% from 35%. President Trump says the new rate should be "no higher" than that. Supporters argue that 35% is one of the highest headline rates in the world, but many companies pay far less once deductions and special tax breaks are included.

Large, profitable U.S. corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of 14% between 2008 and 2012, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

"There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!" he tweeted early Monday. Republicans have been discussing sharp reductions in the amount of money that could be invested tax-free in the popular retirement accounts, according to reports over the weekend in numerous news outlets. Among those working on tax reform, the 401(k) deduction has been part of those discussions for months. To offset deficit increases caused by tax cuts, some popular tax deductions will need to be eliminated. For example, the deduction for state and local taxes is on the chopping block in current discussions.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/19/pf/taxes/trump-tax-plan-and-tax-preparers/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Trump's tax plan isn't as big of a threat to H&R Block as he says|President Donald Trump may talk a lot about creating jobs, but there's one kind he wants to eliminate: Tax preparers. "I want to put H&R Block out of business," Trump said on the campaign trail. "H&R Block probably won't be too happy," he said again in February. Trump is confident that his tax plan will simplify the code enough to make individual filing a snap "If we can do it on one page," Trump said at a press conference on Monday. "Now, in some cases, it may be two pages." In fact, Trump thinks it will be so simple that some taxpayers will be able to do away with their accountants altogether. But so far, tax professionals don't seem very worried. Trump is taking aim at a huge industry: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports there are 70,000 tax preparers in the U.S., which may be an undercount. (H&R Block (HRB) claims 70,000 "tax professionals" in its own franchises, and that doesn't include all of the tax lawyers at big firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Accenture). According to a study by an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, Americans spend $200 billion a year just filing their federal income taxes. Yet despite Trump's promise to render professional tax preparers obsolete, the GOP's tax plan will still leave them with plenty of work to do. The so-called Big Six's Unified Framework — a nine-page statement of principles agreed to by the White House and Congressional leaders — does a few things to make the tax code less complex. It would compress the existing seven individual tax brackets down to three, eliminate "most" itemized deductions and get rid of the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. On the corporate side, it would drop the overall corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, while scrapping some deductions and exemptions for specific industries. Related: The White House explains itself: Why corporate tax cuts mean higher wages But those measures don't affect most Americans, only 30% of whom choose to itemize rather than take the standard deduction, according to the Tax Foundation. At the same time, the plan envisions other changes that would make filing taxes more complex. For example, it expands the child tax credit and adds a $500 credit for dependents like elderly parents, while maintaining exemptions and deductions for mortgage interest, retirement savings, higher education, and charity. (The non-partisan Tax Policy Center has pooh-poohed the GOP's promise to enable individuals to file their taxes on a postcard, pointing out that plenty of worksheets would still be required to figure out how to fill out that postcard's fields.) On the corporate side, the Big Six plan adds a new loophole, which allows businesses to expense their new investments. All of these exemptions may or may not serve as valuable incentives, but they don't help simplify the tax code. Meanwhile, the GOP introduces a large dose of complexity by proposing to tax "pass-through" businesses — which include sole proprietorships and partnerships — at 25%, rather than the top individual tax rate of 39.6%. This reduced rate will incentivize businesses to restructure themselves as pass-throughs if they can. "Any time you get any kind of rate differential for different sources of income, you warm the hearts of every tax planner everywhere," says Joe Thorndike, a tax historian with the non-profit research firm Tax Analysts. "That's great for them, because that's going to create an enormous opportunity to reorganize." Trump's team argues that by cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%, it will make it less attractive for big multinational corporations to lower their taxes through complicated accounting maneuvers like transfer pricing and earnings stripping. Many economists agree. Related: The IMF says Trump won't deliver tax reform "A somewhat lower rate would both reduce incentives to profit shifting and also help smaller firms compete better with their larger counterparts," says Fatih Guvenen, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied corporate tax practices. However, another part of the GOP plan — known as "territorial taxation" — would make profits earned overseas tax-free forever, which will always compare favorably to even the lowest corporate tax rate. That creates an incentive in the other direction, to classify income as foreign rather than domestic, explains Tax Policy Center senior fellow Steven Rosenthal. "There are aspects of the Big Six framework that will create new gaming," Rosenthal says. So even if big corporations stop spending money on complex accounting maneuvers that help shift their profits around, they will still need tax lawyers for plenty of emerging lines of business. "I'm not too terribly worried the tax business is going to change dramatically," says Ramon Camacho, a principal in the international tax practice at RSM US. "But there's always something else to do. Just move into litigation!" And what about the H&R Blocks of the world? They've already been building software that allows taxpayers to file their returns from the comfort of their couches, no human assistance required. In the meantime, they don't seem all that worried about Congress deregulating them out of their jobs. Any change in the tax code, after all, creates demand for professional advice. "It could be simpler, but there's no scenario where it would be simple, the U.S. tax code," said H&R Block CEO Tom Gerke on the company's most recent earnings call. "Every time we get into one of these reform processes, we can't resist adding to it as well."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171017123354-hr-block-tax-sign-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/07/pf/taxes/cut-taxes/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|3 smart ways for investors to cut their taxes|High returns aren't the only factor to consider when choosing your investments. A tax-efficient portfolio can save you enough on your tax bill to nicely compliment your investment returns. Take a look at your own portfolio to see if you've implemented the following tax-shrinking tips. 1. Max out your tax-advantaged accounts Investors have plenty of options for tucking away their money. If you do your investing in accounts with built-in tax advantages, such as HSAs, IRAs, and 401(k)s, you can save a bundle on your tax bill. Investments in these accounts don't generate taxes when you receive dividends from stocks or interest from bonds, and they also won't incur capital gains taxes if you sell an investment for a profit. In addition, IRAs and 401(k)s give you a tax break either on the money you put into the account or the money you take out (depending on whether the account is a traditional tax-deferred account or a Roth account). HSAs actually give you a tax break on both contributions and distributions, making them the only triple tax-advantaged account. These accounts are such a great deal that the IRS has put limits on how much you're allowed to contribute to them each year. So throw your investing dollars into these tax-advantaged accounts until you hit the annual maximum; then and only then should you focus on building up your standard brokerage accounts. 2. Consider tax-advantaged investments Certain investments have built-in tax savings. For example, treasury securities are exempt from state taxes (although you will still have to pay federal taxes on the interest). Municipal bonds take the tax advantage a step further: They are exempt from federal taxes and may also be exempt from state taxes, if the bond was issued by the state you live in. Clearly, if you're going to buy municipal bonds, look for ones from your state of residence to max out the tax savings. A tax-advantaged investment is not always the best choice. The bonds that come with a tax break pay lower returns than bonds that don't, and depending on your situation, the tax break may or may not make up for the lower returns. For example, if you live in a state with high state taxes, tax-free municipal securities are likely to be a good deal -- but if you live in a state with no state taxes, the federal tax savings alone likely won't be enough to turn municipal bonds into a good deal. 3. Don't overlap tax breaks The big selling point of municipal bonds is their potentially high tax break -- but if you put a municipal bond in an IRA, the tax advantage disappears. Why? Because you don't pay taxes on any bond interest that's deposited into an IRA, whether it's from a municipal bond or not. Thus, putting municipal bonds in a tax-advantaged account is a waste of money. Similarly, real estate investment trusts (REITs), while a great investment, can expose you to high taxes because of the very high dividends these securities are required to generate. Tucking your REITs into a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA neatly erases this disadvantage, since the copious dividends that REITs produce will not be taxed as they come in.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/24/pf/taxes/401k-tax-reform/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|How tax reform could affect your 401(k)|Republicans in Congress are gearing up to fight for lower tax rates. But how do you pay for those cuts? One possible solution on the table: Taxing you on your retirement savings up front. Several people in the retirement savings industry fear that lawmakers will choose to "Rothify" some or all of employees' 401(k) contributions. Today, the money you put in a traditional 401(k) is not taxed when you make the contribution. The money grows tax-deferred. But once you start taking funds out in retirement, your withdrawals are taxed as regular income. That's the opposite of how Roth 401(k)s and Roth IRAs work. In a Roth, your contributions are made after-tax, but your gains and withdrawals are then tax-free. If lawmakers opt to "Rothify" 401(k)s, they could treat some or all of your future 401(k) contributions as taxable income the year you make them. Related: The deductions that may be killed by tax reform It's not a new idea. A version of it appeared in the 2014 tax reform proposal put out by Dave Camp, then-chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Under Camp's plan, you would be allowed to contribute pre-tax up to half of the allowable annual contribution limit -- which this year is $18,000. All of your employer's match would also be treated as pre-tax. But any other money you put in would be immediately taxable. Since the taxes paid on long-term savings would be front loaded, Rothifying 401(k)s could raise revenue in the short term -- Camp's proposal was estimated to raise nearly $144 billion over a decade. That would appear to help "pay for" the permanent tax cuts Republicans want. But the change would lose money over time because the federal government would not get as much in revenue when employees retire and begin to make tax-free withdrawals. Such a timing shift is a fiscal gimmick, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "It produces savings in the near term by deferring costs to the long term." Related: How much can I expect to earn on my retirement savings? Okay, but would it be a good deal or a bad one for retirement savers? No one knows. "There's really no research dealing with the topic of how workers and employers might react," Nevin Adams, communications chief for the American Retirement Association, noted in a recent blog post. That may change soon. The Employee Benefit Research Institute is currently studying how Rothification might affect retirement outcomes. In the meantime, there is industry pulse-taking. The Plan Sponsor Council of America found the vast majority of the 400 employer-sponsored-plan providers surveyed think Rothifying 401(k)s would be a bad idea, and that policymakers should give employers maximum flexibility to design their savings plans to best suit the needs of their workforce. PSCA is part of the newly formed Save Our Savings Coalition, made up of plan providers, trade groups and savings education nonprofits. Coalition members' worry Rothifying might dissuade people from saving as much as they would in today's system. As it is, a lot of employers already offer a Roth option to their workers. For instance, at Empower Retirement, the second largest plan provider in the United States, about half of its 37,000 clients do. Across the industry, three-quarters of employer sponsored plans have a Roth feature, according to PSCA. But the take-up rate is fairly low among employees. "When given a choice, American workers overwhelmingly choose traditional accounts over Roth accounts" said Jim McCrery, who had been a top Republican on the Ways and Means and now heads up the Save our Savings Coalition. "Reducing the availability of tax-deferred retirement savings just for the purpose of raising revenue would likely reduce the amount people save, thereby putting the financial security of tomorrow's seniors at greater risk." Then again, Camp estimated that his proposal would only affect 17% of workers who contribute to 401(k)s since most people do not sock away more than half of the allowed annual contribution limit. What is clear is that getting Americans to save enough for retirement is still an uphill battle. Correction: The original story referred to PSCA as the Profit Sharing Council of America. That was the group's original name, but it has since changed to the Plan Sponsor Council of America.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150331142752-retirement-piggy-banks-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/20/news/oil-carbon-tax-payments/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|Big Oil wants to tax itself and give cash to Americans|Here are two shockers: Big Oil wants to tax itself to fight climate change. And it wants the proceeds to go to American families. Major oil companies including ExxonMobil (XOM), BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT) backed a carbon tax proposal on Tuesday that has been gaining traction in Washington. Other big-name backers include billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, physicist Stephen Hawking and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The plan has found support after President Trump announced that he would exit the Paris climate accord, isolating the U.S. from global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and limit rising temperatures. The Climate Leadership Council, which helped assemble the unusual coalition, ran an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that described the proposal as "pro-environment, pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-competitiveness, pro-business and pro-national security." The ad also described the plan as embodying "the conservative principles of free markets and limited government." Here's how the plan would work: Companies would be taxed on the carbon dioxide generated by mining, drilling and other activities conducted in the U.S. The fee would start around $40 per ton and go up from there. The tax proceeds would then be paid out to Americans -- regardless of income level -- in monthly installments through the Social Security Administration. The Climate Leadership Council said the carbon tax could generate an estimated $2,000 for a family of four in its first year. Companies would get a rebate when they export products abroad in order to ensure a level global playing field. Products imported into the U.S. would also be taxed based on their carbon content. Proceeds from this "border adjustment tax" would be paid directly to Americans. The group also suggests that some environmental regulations won't be needed if the tax on carbon emissions is high enough. Related: The prize for doing business better: $12 trillion Writing in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Summers and former secretary of state George Shultz argued that the plan addresses Trump's concerns about the Paris accord by ensuring that American firms are not put at a disadvantage. They assured skeptics that "our long experience in Washington has taught us that the transition from the inconceivable to the inevitable can sometimes be very rapid." The proposal is not likely to win support from all corners. The cost of the tax could be passed from companies to consumers, and some environmentalists argue that market forces are no substitute for effective regulation when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. "ExxonMobil will try to dress this up as climate activism, but its key agenda is protecting executives from legal accountability for climate pollution and fraud," Greenpeace campaigner Naomi Ages said. Related: Solar energy is killing coal, despite Trump's promises Analysts also say the plan would be very difficult to implement. "Viewed in glorious isolation from the rest of the world, it has a lot going for it," said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at strategic advisory firm Global Counsel. "But as soon as you start looking at how they propose to make it work [with other parts of the world] ... it becomes really complicated and really messy." Irwin said that it would, for example, be hard to calculate fair carbon taxes on imports ranging from oil to cars to semiconductors. The plan also requires political backing and federal legislation, a process that could take years. "It may take another presidential election for this to be fully enacted," said Ted Halstead, who leads the Climate Leadership Council. Halstead, who helped bring Big Oil on board, said he would like to see the U.S. government move ahead with the carbon tax, but other countries like France, China or the U.K. could take the lead instead. "The idea could be started in any country," he said, noting that enacting the rules in one nation could lead to a "domino effect." The Climate Leadership Council published a list of companies and prominent individuals who supported the carbon tax plan on Tuesday.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/05/news/economy/new-york-trump-tax-returns/index.html?section=money_pf_taxes|TRUMP Act would put Trump's New York tax returns online|Some Democratic state senators in New York are trying an end run to get Donald Trump's taxes into the public view by introducing legislation that would reveal his state tax returns for the last five years. The legislation -- dubbed the Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act (or TRUMP Act) -- would require the state to post online the state tax returns of anyone elected to federal or state office in a statewide election, including the president and vice president. Trump is a resident of New York, and bill sponsor Brad Hoylman hopes the legislation will give the public a glimpse at Trump's taxes. "The tax experts I've spoken to think we'll get a good snapshot of what's on his federal form," he said. In fact, the Trump tax return that the New York Times reported on before the election was the top pages of his New York state form. Hoylman argues it's important for Trump's taxes to become public as Congress debates tax reform legislation that could benefit high-income individuals, including the president. Trump has refused to release his tax returns while in office, breaking with a 40-year tradition. He has claimed that ongoing IRS audits prevent him from doing so, even though such audits wouldn't restrict anyone from publishing their returns. And Trump is mandated to be audited during the rest of his time in office. Democrats and a small handful of Republicans, citing Trump's ongoing business interests, have pushed him to release his returns or to pressure Congressional leaders to exercise their authority to obtain them legally. Related: The two biggest ways the Trump family could benefit from his tax plan A separate bill introduced by Hoylman would require anyone appearing on a statewide ballot in New York to release his or her federal tax returns, but that wouldn't force Trump to release anything until 2020, if he runs for a second term. Hoylman said he got the idea for the TRUMP Act from a Washington Post op-ed column written by University of Chicago Law Professor Daniel Hemel. "Trump would almost certainly bring a constitutional challenge to any law requiring him to disclose his [federal] tax returns as a condition for ballot access, and it is far from clear that these laws would hold up in court," Hemel wrote. "But publishing Trump's state tax returns is a much more viable option — and would make his returns available to the public now, rather than three years from now." Related: Trump has 'no intention' of releasing his tax return, Mnuchin says Republicans control the New York Senate because some Democrats have joined with Republicans to form a majority. But Hoylman said he's confident that his bill still has a good chance at being passed into law. "The Republican control of the senate is nominal," he said. "I wouldn't rule out this happening by any means. Public support is widespread." The law requires the release of tax returns only by those elected by statewide vote, so New York's state representatives and senators would not be required to release their own returns. Hoylman has never released his tax return, although he said he's not opposed to doing so.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170505123721-trump-state-taxes-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/20/pf/ready-to-retire/index.html?section=money_retirement|5 steps to making sure you're ready to retire|Dreaming of handing in your notice at work and joining the ranks of the retired? Retirement can be wonderful — if you're prepared for it. So before you put an end to your career, it's essential to make sure you're 100% ready. Not sure how to do that? Taking these five steps can put you on the path to a happy and secure retirement. 1. Coordinate with your spouse If you're part of a twosome, retirement doesn't just affect you; it's a profound lifestyle change for your entire family. Before you take the leap, get on the same page as your spouse. Will you both be retiring, or will your spouse work longer? If your spouse is planning to maintain a career, will you end up being responsible for more household tasks — and are you OK with that? These questions need to be answered. You'll also have to think through how your decision will affect your family finances — especially when it comes to Social Security benefits. If you're claiming Social Security benefits early, you'll reduce the monthly benefits you receive for the rest of your life — as well as any survivors benefits your spouse could receive if he or she were to outlive you. Devise a Social Security claiming strategy with your spouse before you file for benefits that maximizes your combined income, as you can't easily change your plans once benefits have begun. 2. Figure out where your income will come from When you no longer have a paycheck coming in, you'll need funds from other sources. For most people, retirement income comes from Social Security and savings. A lucky few — mostly government workers — have a defined benefit pension plan to provide guaranteed income. For the rest of us, having enough money invested to supplement Social Security is essential. To make sure you won't come up short, add up all your potential sources of retirement funds — from pensions, Social Security, and withdrawals from retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs — and figure out what your total monthly income will be. Estimate your Social Security income by visiting mySocial Security to find your benefit amount at full retirement age. Once you're logged in, there's a free retirement estimator to help you determine what your benefits will be based on the age you retire. If you're not ready to create an account, the SSA also has a quick calculator available to estimate benefits by inputting your current year's earnings, your birth date, and your future retirement date. To determine the income you'll receive from investments, you could use the 4% rule, which allows you to withdraw 4% of your account balance in your first year of retirement and then adjust that withdrawal amount each year based on inflation. However, there's a chance you'll run out of money by following the 4% rule, so you may want to take another tactic, such as following the advice of experts from the Center for Retirement Research to determine what percentage of your account balance to withdraw annually. When you add up Social Security income, income from investments, and any other money you'll have coming, you can make an informed choice about whether it's feasible to live on the funds available. 3. Set a retirement budget and see if there's a shortfall So how do you know if the total income you'll have will be sufficient to support you? The best way to tell is to actually make a budget. Factor in all of your fixed costs, such as housing, taxes, and insurance. Add up other expenditures such as traveling, clothing, personal care items, transportation, food, and entertainment. And don't forget to include saving: Just because you're no longer investing for retirement doesn't mean you don't need to put aside money for other purposes, such as home repairs or emergencies. Your budget will reveal how much money you'd actually need. If it shows you'll have plenty of income to cover everything, you're good to go and can hand in your notice. If it doesn't, decide between scaling down your expectations for retirement or increasing your retirement income by working longer, saving more, and earning delayed-retirement credits to boost Social Security benefits. 4. Make a plan for healthcare One of the big line items in your budget will be healthcare costs. Seniors often suffer from serious medical conditions, and Medicare doesn't provide the comprehensive coverage most people believe it does. You'll have to pick up a lot of prescription costs on your own; you'll pay premiums and coinsurance expenses; and you'll need to pay out of pocket entirely for care that isn't covered, such as nursing home services. Recent estimates suggest a senior couple in the top percentile for prescription drug use would need $370,000 to be reasonably certain of covering their healthcare needs in retirement. If you don't have that much, explore options such as working longer and investing in a health savings account or purchasing the most comprehensive Medicare Advantage and long-term care insurance available. 5. Consider how you'll spend your time Finally, you need to think about what you'll actually do during retirement. Some seniors suffer health issues, including depression, when they lose their sense of community and purpose. Have a plan to reduce the risk of becoming lonely and disconnected from the world after retirement. Depending upon your interests, this plan could include volunteering with local organizations, joining a senior center, babysitting your grandkids, joining a travel group, or taking exercise classes (seniors can often join a gym for free through Medicare's SilverSneakers program). You could also do some part-time consulting work, either for pay or through volunteer organizations such as SCORE.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/07/retirement/boost-retirement-income/index.html?section=money_retirement|The best way to boost retirement income|Running out of money in retirement is a huge concern. And given that a large number of workers in their 50s and 60s are behind on savings, it's a clear source of stress for those who don't feel adequately prepared. The good news is that there are several tactics you might employ to boost your retirement income, and a popular one is increasing your savings rate during the tail end of your working years. But if you're wondering how to most effectively raise your retirement income, the answer might boil down to working longer. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, working a few extra years has a much bigger impact on boosting retirement income for older workers than increasing retirement plan contributions during their last decade of work. And that's reason enough to consider extending your career. The perks of working longer There are several benefits associated with working longer that make it a solid strategy for boosting retirement income. For one thing, the longer you work, the more opportunity you have to contribute to your nest egg. Currently, adults 50 and over can contribute up to $24,500 annually to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA. So imagine you're 67 and want to retire, but instead, you extend your career by three years and max out a 401(k) during that time. In doing so, you'll add $77,200 to your nest egg if your investments deliver a relatively conservative 5% return. And chances are, that's a more effective tactic than simply boosting your savings rate during the tail end of your career. But let's run some numbers to compare. Imagine your plan has always been to retire at 67, so beginning at age 57, you increase your retirement plan contributions by $200 a month for the next 10 years. If your investments deliver a 7% return during that period (keeping in mind that you can invest more aggressively when your savings window is longer), you'll add about $33,200 more to your nest egg, and that's certainly helpful. But as you can see, working three extra years and maxing out a 401(k) will have a much better result, as you're coming out $44,000 ahead. (And you should, in theory, have no problem maxing out at a time when you were ready to pull the trigger on retirement anyway.) Related: More on retirement planning This is just a single scenario, and there are countless ones to play around with. The point, however, is that if you're looking to boost your retirement income, working longer may be a better way to get there than retiring on time and increasing your savings rate during the latter part of your career. Of course, there are other factors at play that make working longer a more effective choice. When you put in a few extra years in the workforce, you get to not only keep funding your nest egg, but also hold off on withdrawing from your savings, thereby giving your money additional time to grow. Furthermore, working longer might allow you to boost your Social Security benefits, thereby securing a higher income stream for life. For each year you hold off on taking benefits past your full retirement age, as determined by the Social Security Administration, you'll snag an 8% boost on your Social Security payments that will remain in effect for as long as you collect them. So let's say your full retirement age is 67, at which point you'd get $1,400 a month in benefits (which is roughly what the average recipient collects today). Working until age 70 will increase your monthly payments to $1,736. Over a 20-year retirement, that's an additional $80,640 in income.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/retirement/women-men-retirement/index.html?section=money_retirement|Why are women only saving half as much as men for retirement?|All working Americans need retirement savings, regardless of gender. But the need is particularly strong for women, since they have a tendency to live longer than their male counterparts. They're also more likely to require paid care at some point — as a spouse may not be around to provide care. It's therefore unsettling to learn that women are only saving about half as much as men for the future. In a recent Student Loan Hero study, women had an average of $45,614 socked away for retirement, whereas men had $90,189. That sort of gap could put women at a severe disadvantage later in life. Why are women falling behind savings-wise? When asked why they're struggling to save for retirement, women cited living paycheck to paycheck and having to pay back student loans as their greatest deterrents. Then again, so did men. So why is it that the average female saver only has about half as much as her male counterpart? For one thing, in the aforementioned study, women were more likely than men to own up to a lack of knowledge about investing and retirement planning. Furthermore, women are generally more likely than men to take breaks in their careers to serve as caregivers, thereby reducing their savings ability. Finally, though some folks believe that the wage gap is narrowing, it still appears that women earn significantly less than men on an across-the-board basis. So it's easy to see why their savings balances fail to keep up with men's. If you're looking to retire comfortably, it's crucial that you get a handle on your savings as early on in your career as possible. The good news? If you're behind, there are several tactics you can use to catch up. Boosting your retirement savings One of the most effective ways to ramp up on retirement savings is to examine your budget and identify ways to cut corners. This could mean downsizing your living space, giving up a convenient but not needed car, or cutting back on leisure. The more cash you free up on a monthly basis, the more you'll have available to contribute to a retirement plan. Furthermore, if you have a 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to capitalize on whatever matching dollars your employer is willing to give you. This way, you'll not only add to your savings balance, but the additional money you invested will boost your account's overall growth. And speaking of growth, you may want to change your approach to investing if your savings have been sluggish to date. Though stocks carry more risk than safer investments, like bonds, they're a good way to score some sizable returns on your savings. And that could be the key to catching up and retiring with enough money to pay the bills. Case in point: Saving $300 a month for the next 25 years will leave you with an additional $228,000 in your nest egg if your investments generate an average annual return of 7% during that time. But if you play it too safe and only manage to swing a 4% average return over the life of your investments, you'll wind up with just $150,000. Incidentally, in a separate study by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, women identified not investing more as their single greatest financial regret, so that's reason enough to get a little bit braver with regard to your nest egg. Finally, don't hesitate to fight for raises throughout your career, because the more you earn, the easier it'll be to aggressively fund your IRA or 401(k). Job site Glassdoor has a handy "Know Your Worth" tool that allows you to compare salary data by job title and geographic region. If you do your research and find that you're being underpaid compared to your peers (male or otherwise), you can build a case for more money and use that additional cash to ramp up your savings.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/29/retirement/simplify-retirement-investments/index.html?section=money_retirement|How can I simplify my retirement investments?|I'm retired and currently manage my IRA portfolio of 10 different funds. But I'm thinking I'd like to simplify my portfolio and my life. Short of hiring an adviser to oversee my investments, what do you recommend?—Paul It's no surprise to me that you'd want to streamline your investment approach. After all, retirement is a time when you want to enjoy life, whether that means pursuing new interests, savoring the extra free time you have after calling it a career or both. So if monitoring the performance of your retirement portfolio and periodically rebalancing your holdings to maintain the right balance between risk and return interferes with your ability to live retirement as you please, then by all means you should take steps to simplify your investing strategy. Fortunately, there are several relatively easy ways you can do just that. One would be to simply invest your IRA money in a target-date retirement fund. The beauty of doing that you get not just a fund, but a fully diversified portfolio that's appropriate for various stages of retirement. That said, if you go with this option, you still have some decisions to make. For example, if you're in your mid- to late-60s and already retired or planning to retire soon, you could choose a 2020 target-date fund, which might start with an asset mix of, say, 55% stocks and 45% bonds. The fund would then gradually scale back its stock holdings until it reaches, say, a 25% to 30% stock stake by the time you're in your early- to mid-70s. On the other hand, if you're already in your 70s — or you just prefer a more conservative portfolio — you could go directly to a target retirement income fund, which maintains a steady asset mix, generally 25% to 30% stocks, with the rest in bonds and, perhaps, some cash. The percentages above are by way of illustration only. Not all target date funds, even those geared toward investors of the same age, invest their assets exactly the same way. So before you buy a target-date fund, you'll want to make sure you're comfortable with how it divvies up its assets today as well as how that mix might change in the future. Related: 3 ways to recover from a late start on retirement planning You might also consider life-cycle funds, which are also known variously as life-strategy or target-risk funds. Unlike target-date funds, which with the exception of target retirement income funds ratchet down the fund's risk level over time, life-cycle funds keep investing risk constant by setting an asset allocation and sticking to it. The idea is that you decide on the amount of investing risk you wish to maintain throughout retirement and then find a life-cycle fund with an asset mix to match. Fund families that include life-cycle funds in their lineup typically offer a broad range of asset allocations to choose from: a very conservative, or income, fund that would limit its stock exposure to, say, 20% to 25% of assets; a conservative choice that might invest 40% to 45% in stocks; a moderate fund with a stock allocation of 60% to 65%; and, a growth fund that might invest upwards of 80% or more of its assets in equities. I think it's fair to say that most retirees would probably gravitate more toward a very conservative, conservative or moderate allocation with stock exposure somewhere between 20% and 60% of assets, as portfolios with higher percentages of stocks can easily lose 25% or more of their value during severe market downturns. And, indeed, as long as you start with a reasonable withdrawal rate, you don't have to go overboard on stocks to avoid running through your nest egg too soon. To get a sense of what stocks-bonds mix might be right for you — and to see how various blends of stocks and bonds have performed in good and bad markets in the past — you can check out this risk tolerance-asset allocation tool. If you're not comfortable picking a target-date or life-cycle fund, another possibility is to go with a robo-advisor, or a company that employs algorithms to create portfolios, typically consisting of exchange traded funds (ETFs), based on your financial goals and tolerance for risk. After creating your portfolio, robos will automatically rebalance your holdings and, in some cases, provide tax-loss harvesting to enhance the after-tax returns for savings invested in taxable accounts. Be aware, though, that many robos deal with their clients primarily, if not exclusively, online, although some, including Betterment, Schwab Intelligent Advisory and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services provide access to humans and may also be able to help create a plan for withdrawing money from retirement accounts. Related: Do I really need a financial adviser? Whichever route you decide to take, be sure to check out fees, as they can vary widely. Take the case of target-date retirement funds. Although this 2017 Morningstar report shows that target-date funds' overall asset-weighted annual expenses average 0.71%, you can easily find ones that charge much, much less. For example, the expense ratios for Vanguard's target-date funds range from 0.13% to 0.15% a year, Fidelity's Freedom Index target-date funds charge 0.14% of assets annually, while Schwab's Target Index Funds have annual expenses of just 0.08% a year. There's no guarantee that lower expenses will lead to higher returns, but research shows low-cost funds tend to outperform their high-cost counterparts. So whether you're going with a target-date, life-cycle fund or robo-adviser, it pays to compare costs. (And in the case of robo-advisers, that means looking into not just what the robo charges, but the cost of the underlying investments as well.) Bottom line: There are plenty of choices out there that can help you simplify investing, although you'll definitely need to take some time to assess the different options and come up with the one that makes the most sense for you. But once you no longer have that 10-fund portfolio competing for your attention, you should be able to better focus on what really matters at this stage of life, enjoying your time in retirement.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151202114058-illustration-savings-retirement-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/21/retirement/late-start-on-retirement-planning/index.html?section=money_retirement|3 ways to recover from a late start on retirement planning|I haven't made the best decisions when it comes to retirement planning. As a result, my wife and I are in our early 50s and have next to nothing saved for retirement. Do we have any hope of a secure retirement?—John If it's any consolation, you're not alone. When the Employee Benefit Research Institute asked workers as part of its latest Retirement Confidence Survey how much they had set aside for retirement, more than a third of those between the ages of 45 and 54 who answered said they had less than $25,000 saved, while more than a quarter of those 55 and older said they had less than that 25 grand tucked away. But while your trepidation at nearing retirement age with very little saved is understandable, your situation isn't hopeless. You still have enough time to significantly improve your retirement prospects, if you're willing to start taking serious steps now. Here are the three most important things you need to do: 1. Start saving your you-know-what off Let me be blunt about this. To go from saving virtually nothing to saving diligently is going to require real discipline and some major lifestyle adjustments. But unless you're willing to make a concerted effort to spend less and save more, your chances of being able to live anything close to your current lifestyle after you retire are slim. If you do make the commitment to save, however, you can still come up with a pretty decent nest egg in the waning years of your career. For example, if you and your wife are able to save, say, $500 a month and earn a 6% annual return on that money over the next 15 years or so, you would enter retirement with a stash of more than $145,000, according to this savings interest calculator. If you can manage to save $1,000 a month, you'll be looking at more than $290,000. Obviously, the amount you end up with will depend on how much you actually set aside and what rate of return your savings earn. But the more you can sock away, the larger the nest egg you'll end up with. That said, I don't want to suggest that you'll be able to save enough in the time you have left to put you on easy street. For example, based on the 4% withdrawal rule a nest egg of $290,000 would generate annual income of just under $12,000, or a little less than $1,000 a month. That won't allow you to live large. But it's probably enough at the margin to materially improve your retirement lifestyle. Related: Do I really need a financial adviser? If possible, you'll want to do most of your saving in an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k), which, aside from its tax advantages, has generous contribution limits ($18,500 this year, plus a $6,000 catch-up contribution for people 50 and older) and makes saving easier by automatically transferring money from your paycheck to your account. If you don't have access to a 401(k), you can open an IRA, which allows you to set aside up to $5,500 a year, plus an extra $1,000 for people 50 and older. But whether you save in a 401(k), an IRA, a taxable account or some combination of those three, the point is that the sooner you start doing so and the more you put away, the better your chances of having a secure retirement will be. A quick note on investing your savings: You may be tempted to invest aggressively to earn higher returns and boost the value of your nest egg. Resist that urge. If the market goes into a major downturn, that strategy can backfire and leave you saddled with big losses that you may not have enough time to recover from by the time you retire. A better approach is to build a diversified portfolio of low-cost stock and bond funds that provides a shot at reasonable investment gains consistent with your tolerance for risk. 2. Stay on the job longer In a recent study titled "The Power of Working Longer," retirement researchers showed that postponing retirement and continuing to work can be one of the most effective ways of boosting your post-career standard of living, often more helpful than increasing your savings rate. The main reason is that to the extent staying in the workforce allows you to delay claiming Social Security, you can qualify for a larger monthly Social Security check down the road. For example, each year between the age of 62 and 70 that you put off collecting Social Security, you increase your benefit by roughly 7% to 8%. (You receive no increase for delaying beyond age 70.) And since the money you earn during those extra working years also counts in determining your benefit, the amount you receive could increase even more, which means delaying just a few years might boost your eventual payment by 20% to 25%, if not more. To see how much your monthly benefit might rise by working longer, you can to Social Security's Retirement Estimator. Continuing to work can help in other ways too. You have more years to salt away money for retirement, and your nest egg has more time to rack up investment gains and grow before you tap it. And, of course, any extra years you work are years your nest egg doesn't have to support you, which, all else equal, means you should be able to draw more from savings stash each year without increasing the risk of running through your savings too soon. As effective as working longer can be, however, don't count on staying on the job. The Employee Benefit Research Institute has consistently found that nearly half of workers retire sooner than they expected, often because of health issues, layoffs or because they have to care for a spouse or other family member. So by all means plan on working an extra year or two or three to enhance your retirement security. But don't slack off on saving now because you think you'll be able to compensate by extending your career. 3. Be flexible and resourceful Depending on how far behind you've fallen in your retirement planning efforts, you may not realistically be able to save enough or put in enough extra years in your job to make up for lost time. Which means you need to be open to other ways to enhance your retirement security. One possibility is to look for sources of extra income aside from Social Security and your savings. If you're a homeowner, for example, you may be able to tap the equity in your home for extra retirement spending cash by downsizing to a smaller, less expensive home in your area or by staying in your current digs and taking out a reverse mortgage. You can explore both options by checking out this guide from the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. Related: Is there a low-risk way to avoid running out of money in retirement? You may also be able to generate additional income to supplement Social Security and draws from your nest egg by finding part-time work (assuming you're healthy enough to hold down a job and can find work you consider acceptable). You can get an idea of what sort of job opportunities are available to older workers and retirees by going to such sites as RetiredBrains and RetirementJobs.com. Then there are more, shall we say, radical moves you might consider. For example, you may effectively be able to stretch your retirement income by relocating to an area with lower living costs. To compare expenses in various cities, you can check out the Cost of Living section at Sperling's Best Places site and NerdWallet's Cost of Living Calculator. For that matter, if you relocate and downsize at the same time, you may be able to reduce your living expenditures while also coming away with an extra chunk of investable cash that can serve as a supplement to your nest egg. Bottom line: I'm not saying it will be easy or that you can put yourself in the same position for retirement you would have been in had you saved throughout your career. But if you combine several of the steps I've outlined here — and keep an eye out for even more ways to generate more post-career income or lower your future expenses — you can still improve your chances of achieving a secure retirement.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150701114155-middle-class-growth-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/13/retirement/do-i-need-a-financial-adviser/index.html?section=money_retirement|Do I really need a financial adviser?|If I just invest my money in some good low-cost mutual funds, do I really need to pay a financial adviser for help?—Daniel The answer depends on you — but not just on your ability to pick mutual funds. Ideally, you also want to be sure you can put those funds to work in a coherent strategy to achieve your financial goals. Let's start, though, by taking a closer look at the specific issue of choosing funds. You say you want to invest in good funds with low costs. That makes perfect sense. But even with those two criteria (both of which, while sound, nonetheless allow lots of room for interpretation), you'd still have hundreds of funds to choose from. There are certainly ways you can narrow down the choices. For example, you can home in on funds with below-average annual expenses and solid long-term performance by revving up to a tool like Morningstar's Mutual Fund Screener. Or better yet, you could simply limit yourself to index funds, which not only have low costs but also track the performance of a market index or benchmark. But even if you go the index fund route, you still have dozens of index funds to choose from, as many focus on specific segments of the market — large-stock index funds, small-cap, growth, value, short-term bonds, long-term bonds, etc. Here too, there's an easy way for you to cut through the clutter. Focus on index funds that give you a broad swath of the market rather than a small slice of it — namely, a total US stock market index fund, a total US bond market index fund and, if you want international exposure, a total international stock index fund and a total international bond index fund. Related: Is there a low-risk way to avoid running out of money in retirement? You're still not done, however. You also have to decide how much of your money to allocate to each of these funds, so you end up with a portfolio that gives you a decent shot at the returns you need without subjecting you to more risk than you can handle. Again, this is an issue you should be able to navigate on your own, as there are relatively simple ways to figure out how to spread your money around. By spending a few minutes with this risk tolerance-asset allocation tool, for example, you can come away with a recommended mix of stocks and bonds that makes sense given, among other things, how long your money will be invested and how far you're willing to see your portfolio's value drop during market setbacks. Or, if you want to take an even easier approach, you could invest in a target-date fund, a type of fund that provides an entire diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in a single fund. All of which is to say that I think that many people can not only identify good low-cost funds on their own, but also create a diversified portfolio that achieves a reasonable trade-off between risk and return (and then maintain that trade-off through periodic rebalancing). But the question is, Are you one of those people? Building and maintaining a portfolio of funds is hardly a superhuman task. But it does require some thought, a little initial effort and then some follow-up and monitoring. One more thing: Up to now, we've focused only on investing. But creating a portfolio of good low-cost funds alone won't put you on the road to financial security. You also need to address broader issues, including how much you need to save, whether you're on track to a secure retirement (and, if not, how to get up to speed) and, once retirement is within sight, how to come up with a viable plan to turn your savings into steady income that will support you the rest of your life. Related: 4 tips for investing a big windfall in today's market Once again, these are all matters that many individuals can resolve on their own. For example, to see if you're making adequate progress toward retirement, you can check out Fidelity's Get Your Retirement Savings Factors tool. And if you want to gauge how much you can withdraw from your nest egg without running out of money too soon, you can go to T. Rowe Price's Retirement Income Calculator. This is where a realistic self-assessment comes in. You have to determine whether you're comfortable taking on these financial issues on your own and decide if you can address them adequately. If you're confident that you can, fine. Go for it. But it's important that you be honest with yourself. If you decide you're not okay with flying solo — or at least not for now — then it probably makes sense to look for help. That doesn't mean you have to hire someone on an ongoing basis. You could opt for an adviser who's willing to provide advice on a specific issue — building a portfolio, investing IRA rollover money, creating a retirement income plan, whatever — for a flat or hourly fee. But whatever type of assistance you end up getting, you want to make sure you're paying a reasonable amount and, even more important, dealing with someone who's competent and trustworthy. Asking these five questions can help on that score. As I'm sure you've gathered by now, I can give you some guidance about how to better think about the question you've asked and how to gauge whether you need a pro's help. But I can't give you a definitive answer. You'll have to come up with that.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180308015618-work-wives-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/06/retirement/running-out-of-money-in-retirement/index.html?section=money_retirement|Is there a low-risk way to avoid running out of money in retirement?|I plan to invest half of my savings in a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund, half in a total bond market index fund, withdraw 3.5% the first year of retirement and then adjust that amount annually for inflation. Is this a low-risk way to ensure my money will last throughout a long retirement?—J.R. I can't guarantee that you won't outlive your money if you follow your plan. But I do think that if you embark on retirement with your strategy and are willing to make some adjustments along the way, there's a good chance that your nest egg will be able to sustain you throughout a post-career life of 30 or more years. The most important thing is that you're starting with a reasonable initial withdrawal amount. As you probably know, the 4% rule, or withdrawing 4% of the value of your savings initially and then adjusting that dollar amount annually for inflation, has long been considered the go-to strategy if you want to ensure your savings will last at least 30 years. But with many investment pros projecting lower investment returns in the years ahead, a number of retirement experts (although not all) believe that 4% might be too ambitious, and thus some recommend starting with an initial withdrawal of around 3% or so. Your 3.5% is a bit higher than that, but it's hardy what I'd consider profligate or imprudent. Related: 4 tips for investing a big windfall in today's market As for your retirement portfolio, I don't see anything that would raise red flags there either. A 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds should be able to generate enough growth to maintain your purchasing power while also providing a decent level of protection during market corrections and bear markets. Just to make sure that your asset allocation jibes with your tolerance for risk, however, I suggest you take a few minutes to complete this risk tolerance-asset allocation questionnaire. If it turns out that even a 50-50 mix represents a little more risk than you're prepared to handle, you might want to scale back your stock stake a bit. To see how your chances of depleting your nest egg too soon might vary based on different asset allocations and different withdrawal rates, you can check out this retirement income calculator. I'd also note that, while I have no problem with the two index funds you already have, they don't give you exposure to small-cap stocks or the international markets. I'm not saying that you're jeopardizing your retirement if you limit yourself to these two funds. But you might consider broadening your diversification. You can do that pretty easily by adding a small-cap index fund to your portfolio or replacing your S&P 500 index fund with a total US stock market index fund (which includes small stocks) and by investing a portion of your savings in a total international stock index fund and a total international bond index fund. You should know, however, that a retirement income plan requires more than just setting a withdrawal rate and coming up with an appropriate asset allocation for your savings. Fact is, the financial markets — not to mention your retirement income needs — can change, sometimes dramatically. So you have to be ready to make adjustments as you go along. For example, even with the relatively modest withdrawal rate you're contemplating, it's possible that a meltdown in the market, especially if it occurs early in retirement, combined with withdrawals from savings could so deplete your nest egg's value that it might have trouble recovering even after the markets rebound. The result could be that you run out of money more quickly than projected. Conversely, if the financial markets thrive, sticking to your inflation-adjusted 3.5% withdrawal strategy could leave you with a sizable nest egg late in life, possibly even one larger than you started with. That may not seem like much of a problem, and may not be if you'd planned to leave a large legacy to your heirs. But ending up with a big pot of savings in your dotage could also mean that you could have spent more freely and enjoyed life more earlier in retirement. Related: How should I invest my nest egg for maximum retirement Income? So how can you mitigate the risk of running through your money too soon while not stinting unnecessarily on withdrawals and spending? Flexibility is the key. For example, if your nest egg's value takes a hit in a given year because the market dropped or because you had to withdraw a larger-than-scheduled amount to meet an emergency, you might forego an inflation increase or even scale back your withdrawal a bit the next year or two to give your portfolio a chance to recover. Conversely, if your nest egg's value starts to swell because of strong investment performance, you could use that growth as an opportunity to boost spending, perhaps take an extra trip or otherwise indulge yourself. You can get a sense of what size adjustments, if any, may be in order by periodically revisiting the retirement income calculator I mentioned above and, depending on whether the chances of your money running out are rising or falling, reduce or increase withdrawals. Alternatively, you could employ a "dynamic" approach to retirement spending like the one outlined in this Vanguard paper, which lays out a "ceiling and floor" system of boosting or paring back withdrawals within specific limits based on the prior year's spending and your portfolio's performance. Or, for a different perspective on drawing down your nest egg, you could try the new LifePath Spending tool that asset manager BlackRock has recently made publicly available on its website. Unlike other tools that attempt to answer the likelihood that a given level of spending will last a specified number of years, the BlackRock tool asks your age and how much you have saved and then estimates how much you can spend year by year throughout retirement based on longevity assumptions and the firm's forecast for market returns. Of course, no withdrawal system can guarantee your money will last a lifetime (although, granted, if the amount you pull out each year is so small relative to the size of your nest egg, your chances of running out could be infinitesimal). But if you want to be sure that you can count on at least some guaranteed lifetime income in addition to Social Security, you can always devote a portion of your nest egg to an immediate annuity or longevity annuity, and then rely on a combination of annuity payments and withdrawals from your investment portfolio for your spending cash. If this idea appeals to you, you'll want to make sure you know how to choose an annuity before you commit to one. The main point, though, is that you want your nest egg to last and you want to enjoy retirement as much as possible given the resources you have, you can't just set a withdrawal rate and put it on autopilot. You've got to be prepared to make adjustments in response to the shifts and changes that are a normal part of the financial markets and life.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180117111446-retirement-annuity-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/retirement/401k-match/index.html?section=money_retirement|How supersavers cheat themselves out of 401(k) matches|401(k) plans can be the most useful tool you have in saving for retirement. With these tax-favored retirement accounts featuring ultra-high contribution limits of $18,500 for those who are younger than 50 and $24,500 for those who are 50 or older in 2018, well-off workers often seek to max out their annual 401(k) contributions. Moreover, the fact that many employers add their own matching contributions to the money that you set aside from your own salary is just icing on the cake for retirement savers. Yet there's a trap for those unwary supersavers who seek to set aside as much as they possibly can in a 401(k). If you're not careful with how you manage your savings over the course of the year, you can end up missing out on a portion of the employer matches that you'd otherwise be entitled to receive. Fortunately, it's not hard to find a way around this problem once you're aware of it, but if you don't act, it can cost you thousands of dollars in missed matching contributions. The way matching contributions work Many employers choose to provide matching contributions in order to give their workers more incentive to save toward retirement in their 401(k) accounts. Typically, an employer that offers matching contributions will pick a certain percentage of your salary that it will match, along with the proportion of your own contributions it will match. Some employers match your contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to a certain maximum amount, while others will provide a different amount, such as $0.50 for every $1 you contribute. For example, one common matching provision involves employers matching the first 6% of your salary, either with $0.50 or $1 for every $1 in your own contribution. So, if you make $60,000 and get paid once a month, you could choose to contribute 6% of your $5,000 monthly paycheck, or $300. Your employer would then match that with an employer contribution of $150 or $300, depending on the matching provision. Over the course of the year, that'd add up to contributions of $3,600 from you and either $1,800 or $3,600 more from your employer in the form of matching. However, you could save a lot more than $3,600 if you wanted to. If you set aside 30% of your pay, you'd have total annual contributions of $18,000 — just below the $18,500 maximum for 2018. You'd still get the same match, though, because it applies only to the first 6% you save in your 401(k). The problem with supersavers Neither of the two examples above risks losing any employer matching contributions. But a potential problem comes in if you max out your 401(k) early. That's because once you hit the yearly contribution maximum, your employer will stop taking money out of your paycheck to go toward your 401(k). In some cases, employers also then stop the match — they haven't yet matched the given percentage of salary. For example, take the same example above where you save 30% of your salary, but assume that you make $92,500 instead of $60,000. Your monthly pay of just over $7,700 would lead to monthly contributions of $2,312.50, and if you had a dollar-for-dollar match on the first 6% of salary, you'd receive $462.50 in matching contributions. However, at that rate, you'd hit the $18,500 maximum eight months into the year. Beginning in September, your employer would no longer take 401(k) contributions out of your check, and you'd stop getting the $462.50 per month match. For the year, you'd get only eight months' worth of matching, or $3,700, rather than the $5,550 you should have gotten. How to fix the problem To avoid this situation, you have to be smart about how much you save. Specifically, you need to time things so that you max out your 401(k) when you get your last paycheck of the year. That way, you'll get the full match. In the above example, if you divide the $18,500 maximum contribution by the $92,500 salary, you get 20%. So to max out your 401(k) with perfect timing, you'll want to set your contribution at 20% of salary instead of 30%. By doing so, you'd contribute about $1,540 per month, and that'd be enough to get the same $462.50 monthly match. At the end of 12 months, you'd have contributed the same $18,500 maximum, but you'd also have received the full $5,550 available in matching contributions.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/31/retirement/save-for-retirement/index.html?section=money_retirement|How to save for retirement when you're living paycheck to paycheck|When you're struggling just to pay the bills each month, retirement may seem like an impossible dream. If you're not saving much (or at all) for retirement, you're not alone: Roughly one-third of Americans have nothing at all saved for retirement, according to a 2016 study from GOBankingRates, and another 23% have less than $10,000 in their retirement funds. It's easy to tell yourself that you'll put off saving until you start making more money. But that's an easy trap to fall into, and before you know it, you could be just a few years away from retirement with little to no savings. Even if you're barely making enough to cover your expenses, it's better to start saving for retirement earlier rather than later. That may seem like a tough task, but the earlier you start saving, the easier it will be. Just a few dollars a week can amount to thousands over time thanks to the power of compound interest, so you don't need to save a lot to see a significant impact. Start saving when time is on your side The best time to start saving is when you still have a few decades before you plan to retire, as that gives your money more time to accumulate interest. And the earlier you start, the less you'll need to contribute each month to see major gains down the road. For example, say you can contribute $60 per month toward retirement — just $15 a week — and you're earning a 7% annual rate of return on your investments. After 35 years, that $60 per month will have turned into $100,000. On the other hand, if you put off saving for a few years, it will be harder to catch up. If you want to save $100,000 but only have 10 years before you plan to retire, for instance, you'll need to contribute a staggering $600 per month, assuming the same 7% return on investment. Retirement planning isn't an all-or-nothing game, so rather than putting off saving entirely until you're earning more money, it's wiser to save whatever you can now (no matter how little that is), then increase your contributions when you start earning more. Say, for example, that you can only contribute $25 per month to your retirement fund now, but five years from now, you get a raise and can start contributing $50 per month. Another five years down the road, you can save $75, and you maintain that rate for 25 years more. Assuming you're earning a 7% annual rate of return on those contributions, you'll have a total of about $88,800. Meanwhile, if you had never increased your $25 monthly contribution throughout those 35 years, you'd have just $41,500 in the end. How to make the most of the cash you have Understanding the importance of saving what you can is one thing, but actually finding cash to invest is another. While you can always cut back in some areas — perhaps by skipping the morning latte or cooking at home rather than dining out — there are other, highly effective ways to make the most of your money. For example, if your employer offers matching 401(k) contributions, take full advantage of them, because they can potentially double your savings. Say, for instance, your employer will match 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your salary, and you're earning $50,000 per year. That means your company will match contributions of up to $1,500 per year, or $125 per month. If you contribute that amount to your 401(k), you'll bring your total monthly savings to $250. Earn 7% return on your investments — which will likely require you to invest primarily or entirely in stocks and/or stock-focused mutual funds — and you'll have over $280,000 in 30 years. Even if you don't contribute enough to earn the full employer match, it's best to invest whatever you can; otherwise you're leaving free money on the table. If you don't have access to a 401(k), then your next best option is an individual retirement account, or IRA. These tax-advantaged retirement accounts come with the same major tax benefits as 401(k)s, though they won't come with an employer match. IRAs also have lower contribution limits of $5,500 per year (or $6,500 if you're aged 50 or older). However, if you save diligently and invest aggressively, that's plenty to achieve a six-figure retirement fund over the course of a couple of decades.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/30/retirement/investing-a-windfall/index.html?section=money_retirement|4 tips for investing a big windfall in today's market|I'm 53 years old and will soon come into a multi-million dollar sum that I need to manage properly for my retirement and for my children's future. I'm not willing to just hand the reins over to anyone, but I also realize I'm not an experienced investor. I'd like to invest this money so it will continue to grow for all of us, but I don't know where to begin. Any suggestions?—Lori Figuring out how to invest a windfall to ensure long-term financial security can be a challenge at any time even for an experienced investor. But this isn't just any time: interest rates have been rising, stocks have experienced some scary volatility lately and this bull market is looking a little long in the tooth as it enters its ninth year. And, of course, you're not a seasoned investor. So suffice it to say I think you've got your work cut out for you. That said, if you go about this task in a thoughtful, methodical and disciplined manner — and are willing to seek help should you run into trouble — I think you should be able to invest this money in a way that can secure your retirement and perhaps your children's future as well. Here are four things I suggest you do to improve your chances of success: 1. Get a realistic handle on how much risk you're willing to take. If there's one thing that differentiates a savvy investor from one who's just winging it, it's the ability to balance reward vs. risk. Clearly, you want to earn returns high enough to help you attain your financial goals. But you don't want to take on so much risk that you expose yourself to losses you're unable to manage. It would be nice if you could anticipate market selloffs and bail out of stocks just before prices nosedive. But no one's crystal ball is that good, at least not consistently. Instead, your goal should be to create a portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash that will allow you to participate in the gains when the market is doing well but also ride out market downturns during which stock prices can sometimes drop by half or more. Your first step toward doing that is to carve out of your windfall enough cash for an emergency fund, basically enough so that a job layoff or large unexpected expense doesn't force you to sell off investments and disrupt your long-term investing strategy. Whatever amount you decide is right to fund this emergency reserve, the money should go into investments that will hold their value even if the market gets hammered. I'm talking FDIC insured savings accounts, money-market accounts and short-term CDs. Yes, these cash equivalents pay very little. But security, not return, is your focus here (although you can still shoot for competitive returns by visiting sites like Bankrate, GoBankingRates and DepositAccounts). Related: How should I invest my nest egg for maximum retirement Income? As for investing the rest of your windfall, the key is deciding on a mix of stocks and bonds that will give you reasonable returns for the level of risk you're willing to take. Achieving the right trade-off is a judgment call, but you can arrive at a blend of stocks and bonds that makes sense for you by going to this risk tolerance-asset allocation tool. The tool will suggest a mix of stocks and bonds and show you how various mixes have performed in the past. That's not to say you have to go with the tool's exact recommendation. You can fine-tune it if you like. But except for occasional rebalancing, you should largely stick with whatever blend of stocks and bonds you go with. Don't get into the habit of trying to shift your money around based on what you think (or what some market prognosticator predicts) the market is about to do. 2. Diversify, but don't overdo it. Once you know how you want to divvy up your windfall between stocks and bonds, you can focus on specific investments. Here, I recommend you keep it simple. The idea is to diversify so that you're not overly dependent on the fortunes of just a few companies or sectors of the market, but at the same time not spread your money so widely that you have a hard time keeping track of and monitoring your investments. There are a number of ways to get no muss-no fuss diversification. One is to create a portfolio of a few broad index funds. For example, combining a total U.S stock market and a total U.S. bond market index fund will give you exposure to virtually the entire U.S. stock and taxable bond markets. Throw in a total international stock and total international bond index fund and you'll have a portfolio that's broadly diversified both domestically and internationally. If you want to make things even simpler, you can invest in a lifecycle fund or target-date retirement fund, both of which do the allocation work for you by providing a pre-set mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and/or age. Related: 4 steps you should take when buying an annuity You may be tempted to add even more investments to your portfolio. Indeed, some advisers contend that to navigate today's markets you also need to own all manner of "alternative investments," which could mean anything from commodity funds to private equity to cryptocurrency. My advice: tread very carefully. The more you start loading up your portfolio with niche investments, the harder it can be to manage, and you could end up di-worse-ifying rather than diversifying. Once you have a broadly diversified portfolio and cash reserve along the lines outlined above, I'd say the less you tinker with it, the better. 3. Hold the line on fees and expenses. I can't guarantee that sticking to low-fee investments will boost the returns you'll earn. But Morningstar research on the predictive power of fees has shown that funds with low annual expenses generally outperform those with high costs. And by giving up less to fees and allowing more of your money to rack up gains and compound over the long term, the more money you may have for your retirement and, possibly, to pass on to your children. Fortunately, it's pretty simple to home in on low-fee investments these days. For example, you should have no trouble finding broad index funds that charge in the neighborhood of 0.25% or less a year vs. the 1% or more that many funds charge. And if you feel the need to look beyond index funds, you can single out actively managed funds with low expenses by revving up Morningstar's Fund Screener. 4. Don't be afraid to ask for help — but make sure you're getting the right kind. I get that you don't want to turn over your windfall to an adviser. Still, given the amount of money involved here, it would be a shame if mistakes stemming from your inexperience were to jeopardize this shot at financial security for you and your family. I'm not just talking about getting help with investments, although that's probably the type of assistance that first comes to mind. You also need to think about a host of other planning issues, such as laying the groundwork for your eventual retirement, figuring out how much you can safely withdraw from your investment portfolio after you call it a career and arranging the best way to leave to your children any assets that may remain after you're gone. Getting help doesn't mean you necessarily have to completely "turn over the reins," as you say. Instead of paying someone to oversee your finances on an ongoing basis, you could instead go to an adviser for guidance on specific issues and pay by the hour. But whatever route you go, you'll want to make sure that the amount you're paying is reasonable — and that the person you're dealing with is competent and trustworthy.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171108173635-inheritance-money-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/retirement/401k-millionaire/index.html?section=money_retirement|More people are saving $1 million in their 401(k)s. Here's how you can too|Saving $1 million for retirement may sound like an impossible task that not many people have achieved. But about 157,000 people have saved at least $1 million in their 401(k)s with Fidelity, according to the company. Another 148,000 had saved that much in an IRA. Of those, 2,400 people had saved $1 million in both types of accounts. So what's the secret to becoming one of them? Time. Most of these people are Baby Boomers who have saved for at least 30 years. "I think the most important behavior is to start saving early," said Katie Taylor, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity. That's good news for Millennials. If you're still in your 20s or 30s, you can set yourself up now to meet that goal with much less effort than an older person getting a later start. People who've reached the $1 million mark also are saving a bigger percentage of their salary. Those with $1 million in their 401(k) are saving 24% of their salary each year — including both employer and employee contributions. Overall, the average 401(k) participant is saving 13%, according to Fidelity, the biggest plan provider by assets. "The beauty of the 401(k) is that it takes the emotion out of investing," said Chuck Cumello, president and CEO of Essex Financial. Since money is taken out of your paycheck automatically, you're less likely to try to time the market. How do you stack up? Less than 3% of Baby Boomers with a 401(k) at Fidelity have reached $1 million. In 2016, working households aged 55 to 64 with retirement accounts had saved a median of $120,000, according to the Investment Company Institute. It's no surprise that those with higher salaries have saved more. Those older households who earned more than $171,000 a year had saved a median of $600,000 while those who earned less than $35,000 a year had saved a median of $18,000. (The report considered assets in all defined contribution accounts, including both 401(k) and IRAs.) Related: Are you behind on your retirement saving? How can you get to $1 million? Not everyone will need $1 million for retirement, Taylor said. One rule of thumb is to save 10 times your ending salary. If you're far away from retirement age, use an online calculator like this one to get an idea of how much you might need. There are three common traits shared by those who have saved a lot of money in their 401(k)s, said Cumello. 1. Start saving early. If you start at age 25, you'll need to save $650 a month to have $1 million by age 65. But you'd need to save $1,200 a month if you wait to start saving until age 35 (assuming a 5% average return). Calculator: When will I be a millionaire? 2. Work toward saving the maximum allowed. First, save at least as much to get the full company match, Cumello said. Then increase your savings rate until you hit the federal limit. This year it's $18,500. 3. Pay attention to your investments. Most 401(k)s have low-cost fund investment options. Cumello suggests investing in those to create a diversified portfolio. Avoid being too heavily invested in one stock. Are you on track to save $1 million for retirement?

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/retirement/social-security-mistakes/index.html?section=money_retirement|3 Social Security mistakes that could cost you a fortune|Social Security may seem like a relatively easy program to navigate, and in many ways, it is. The application process for retirement benefits is quick and straightforward, and there's little you need to do after you've applied, aside from keeping your bank account and address information current. Having said that, there's more to Social Security strategy than you may think. The wrong moves could cost you tens of thousands of dollars in potential benefits, and here are three missteps to avoid. Claiming too early if you're still working Americans who qualify can claim Social Security anytime between the ages of 62 and 70, and the vast majority of Americans claim at their full retirement age or sooner. In fact, 62 is the most common claiming age, by a significant margin. And to be fair, Social Security is designed so that the average person will get roughly the same amount of benefits (inflation-adjusted) regardless of when they claim. It's also true that once you've reached full retirement age, you are entitled to claim your entire Social Security benefit, no matter how much you earn from work. However, if you've reached your full Social Security retirement age and are still working, it's also important to remember that your earnings can still boost your Social Security benefit. Specifically, the Social Security formula takes your highest 35 years of inflation-indexed earnings into account. And, the later years of many American's careers are also some of their highest-earning years. Here's the key point: A year of relatively high earnings will replace the lowest of the 35 years of earnings used in the Social Security benefit formula. If you're past full retirement age and are earning significantly more now than you were toward the beginning of your career, or if you have some gaps in your work record, holding off on claiming your Social Security retirement benefit could help boost your income in two ways. Not only will your benefit rise by 8% per year for waiting, but your 35-year average could also substantially improve, raising the base benefit amount to which those 8% delayed retirement credits are applied. Delaying a spousal benefit past full retirement age Thanks to Social Security spousal benefits, spouses who didn't work or earned comparatively little throughout their working life are entitled to much-needed retirement income. If your calculated Social Security retirement benefit is less than half of your spouse's, or if you don't qualify at all, a spousal benefit will kick in to make up the difference. In other words, if your spouse is entitled to $1,600 per month at full retirement age, a spousal benefit would ensure that you received $800 per month at your full retirement age. However, there are two very important points you need to know. First, unlike standard Social Security retirement benefits, spousal benefits don't get any bigger after full retirement age. If your spouse's full retirement age is 67, and they wait until 68 to claim a spousal benefit, their monthly check won't get any bigger. Second, the key requirement to be eligible for a spousal benefit is that the higher-earning spouse must have claimed their own benefit already. The bottom line: If your spouse is entitled to a benefit on your work record, think twice before you delay retirement beyond their full retirement age. Not checking your earnings record The Social Security Administration, or SSA, keeps track of your Social Security taxable earnings every year, and you can take a look at your earnings record on your latest Social Security statement. (Note: Your Social Security statement is available on www.ssa.gov by creating a "my Social Security" account, if you haven't already.) Because your benefit will be based on the earnings data on your Social Security statement, it's extremely important to make sure the information on the statement is accurate. Errors in Social Security earnings records aren't widespread, but they are more common than you may think. For example, in the 2012 tax year, the SSA said that $71 billion in wages couldn't be matched to any earnings records, and that only about half of these mismatches were eventually corrected.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/28/retirement/annuities-costs/index.html?section=money_retirement|What costs do annuities have?|While annuities can make sense in certain circumstances, it's important to be aware of the drawbacks before purchasing any type of investment. And with annuities, the main drawback is the cost. They tend to have higher fees than many other investments, and in some cases, the difference can be huge. If you think an annuity could be right for you, here's a rundown of the fees and other costs you can expect to pay. Types of annuity costs One major point you need to know is that many annuity fees either aren't disclosed or are difficult to determine. So, just because a certain type of fee isn't listed in your annuity contract or mentioned to you by an annuity salesperson, don't assume you aren't paying it. With that in mind, here's a list of some of the major annuity expenses you might pay, either directly or indirectly: Commission: The salesperson who sells you an annuity gets a cut, and this can be substantial, as you'll see in the next section. However, you can save yourself money by looking at direct-sold annuities, rather than going through salespeople (who may refer to themselves as "investment advisers"). Management fees: Variable annuities are especially notorious for high management fees. These annuities invest your money in mutual funds, and the fees (known as expense ratios) charged by the underlying mutual funds are passed on to you. Insurance charges: These are also known as mortality and expense (M&E) fees and administrative fees. These cover certain guarantees that come with an annuity, as well as administrative expenses. Surrender charges: Annuities often have penalties known as "surrender charges" that discourage people from pulling their money out early. Other fees: In addition to these common fees, other potential annuity fees include underwriting fees, IRS penalties for early withdrawals in certain cases, fees associated with riders (added features), and more. How much are we talking about? Here's the part to pay close attention to: Annuity fees can be astronomically high. For one thing, annuity commissions often run in the 6% range, and commissions as high as 10% aren't unheard of. As I mentioned earlier, you can avoid paying a high commission by looking at annuities sold directly by companies. Vanguard is an excellent example: Their annuity specialists don't work for commissions and, instead simply charge a one-time 2% fee for income annuities. You can also end up paying high fees on an ongoing basis if you buy a variable annuity. In addition to the costs of the underlying mutual funds, variable annuities come with insurance charges and other fees that can total 2%-3% per year in many cases. As with commissions, not all variable annuity fees are in the same ballpark. For example, Vanguard's mutual funds are notoriously cheap, so this can save you money on an ongoing basis. And it's not just Vanguard; other companies, such as Fidelity and TIAA-CREF, also direct-sell annuities that could be worth a look. In addition, a surrender charge can cost you a lot of money if you decide you want to cash out. A typical surrender charge is 7% of the annuity's value after one year, and it declines by 1% per year until it's gone, although much higher surrender charges are possible.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/25/pf/annuities-bad-reputation/index.html?section=money_retirement|Why do annuities have such a bad reputation?|Running out of money in retirement is such a major concern that many workers fear it more than death itself. And while aggressively funding an IRA or 401(k) during your working years will help lower your risk of depleting your savings in your lifetime, it won't guarantee that you don't wind up strapped for cash when you're older. An annuity, on the other hand, can help eliminate that risk. An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company. With an annuity, you're essentially paying a lump sum of money in exchange for guaranteed payouts for life. Those payments might start right away or begin at some point in the future. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right? Not necessarily. While annuities are a smart investment in theory, there's a reason they tend to get a bad rap. For one thing, they can be awfully confusing and come with their own complicated tax rules and implications. Furthermore, annuities are only as good as the companies that issue them. If you buy an annuity and the insurance company behind it goes under, your so-called guaranteed income stream disappears. But if there's one aspect of annuities that really drags their name through the mud, it's none other than fees. And that's something you need to be aware of before you buy. What will your annuity cost you? Let's be clear: Most investments come with fees in some shape or form. But annuities take that concept to a whole new level. First of all, annuities are frequently (though not always) sold by pushy sales reps who land huge commissions for getting you to buy them. Those commissions can easily hit the 10% mark, and they're often built into the annuity's operating costs, which means that charge is passed along to you, the buyer. Speaking of operating costs, it's not unheard of for annuities, particularly variable ones, to charge 3% to 4% in annual fees. Actively managed mutual funds, by contrast, might charge as little as half that amount. Granted, you're not getting guaranteed income for life with a mutual fund, but it's something to consider nonetheless. Another thing to know about annuities is that they typically come with surrender charges, which means that if you attempt to back out of your contract, you'll be hit with a hefty fee there as well. That fee can be as high as 7% during the first year of your annuity, though it'll typically decline by about 1% annually during your surrender period until it goes away completely. That said, some annuities allow you to withdraw a small portion of your account value each year without facing a surrender charge, but that depends on the specifics of your contract. So are all of those fees worth the guaranteed income? Part of it depends on how long you end up living. If you pass away sooner than expected, you may not end up recouping those fees, or your initial investment, for that matter. Is an annuity right for you? Despite their complexities and sizable fees, annuities can be a smart choice under some circumstances because unlike your IRA or 401(k), they essentially guarantee income for life, provided you pick the right insurer. That said, it generally pays to max out your retirement plan contributions before buying an annuity. But if you're sitting on extra cash and don't want to bear the risk of investing it on a long-term basis, an annuity might work out in your favor. The same holds true if your health is fantastic and you have a strong family history of longevity. That's because the longer you live, the greater your chances of getting the most out of your annuity.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/23/retirement/nest-egg-retirement-income/index.html?section=money_retirement|How should I invest my nest egg for maximum retirement Income?|I'm in my mid 60s and have about $1.2 million I would like to invest for the maximum income possible for the rest of my life. I don't care for stocks or bonds because I hate the idea of seeing the value of my savings drop if the market has a correction. And I don't understand annuities. Any suggestions?—M.B. You've got a number of conflicting wants and needs that you'd do well to sort out if you hope to come up with a sensible plan to convert your nest egg into income that can support you the rest of your life. You say, for example, that you want "the maximum income possible," yet you seem bent on ruling out stocks and bonds, investments that, in combination, have a solid record of being able to deliver the size returns you need to generate a high level of income for the long term. You also express concern about the value of your savings dropping during market downturns. That's understandable. No one enjoys seeing his nest egg take a hit, especially the gut punch of a severe bear market. But this aversion to seeing even a temporary decline is incompatible with your desire for maximum income. The more you dampen up-and-down swings in the value of your retirement portfolio, the more you reduce your return potential, which makes it tougher to get the higher retirement income you seek. You can't have it both ways, a shot at maximum income and total stability. Finally, you say you want this income to last for life. But you then seem to suggest that annuities — a type of investment specifically designed to create a payout you can't outlive — are a no-go. I agree that annuities can be difficult, sometimes almost impossible, to understand. And I don't want to suggest that you must own an annuity. Still, if you really want retirement income you can count on for the rest of your life, I think it's at least worth considering whether an annuity might make sense. All of which is to say that I think you need to consider setting a more realistic goal when it comes to retirement income — namely, creating a plan that can get you a reasonable amount of sustainable income given your resources, while limiting volatility to a manageable level rather than trying to do away with it altogether. Related: 4 steps you should take when buying an annuity The first step toward creating such a plan is to get a handle on how much income you'll need to cover your retirement expenses. You can do that by going to an online budgeting tool like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet, which has room for you to enter dozens of retirement expenses ranging from essential outlays for housing, food, health care and transportation to more discretionary expenditures for travel, entertainment and charitable donations. Once you've toted up your expenses, you can then see how much of those costs you'll be able to pay for with assured income from sources like Social Security and any pensions. If you haven't already begun drawing Social Security, you can see what size monthly check you might receive by going to the Social Security Administration's Retirement Estimator tool. More likely than not, there will be a gap — i.e., your expenses will exceed the amount you'll collect from Social Security and any pensions. The simplest way to fill that gap is to draw enough from savings each year to cover the expenses that Social Security and any pensions can't. Question is, how do you do this without running through your savings too quickly? Start by being judicious about withdrawals. If you want your nest egg to last 30 or more years — a reasonable assumption given today's long life spans — you should probably limit yourself to an initial withdrawal of no more than 3% to 4% of the value of your savings. You can then increase that amount each year by the inflation rate to maintain your purchasing power. Assuming an initial withdrawal of 4% and annual inflation of 2% would, in your case, translate to withdrawing $48,000 the first year of retirement (4% of $1.2 million), about $49,000 the second year ($48,000 plus 2% inflation), roughly $50,000 the third year ($49,000 plus 2% inflation), etc. You can always withdraw more, but the more you pull out, the greater the chance you may exhaust your savings too soon. How you invest your retirement savings also plays a role in determining how long your nest egg might last. I get that you have an aversion to seeing the value of your savings decline during periods of market turmoil. To totally avoid that possibility, however, you would pretty much need to invest all your savings in cash equivalents like money-market accounts and CDs. Problem is, these investments generate such low returns that, even if you limit yourself to a withdrawal rate of 3% to 4%, you would still run a not insignificant risk of outliving your savings. So unless you're willing to cut back on the amount you withdraw each year — or accept a higher risk of running out of money before you run out of time — you need the more generous returns that a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds (or, more likely stock and bond funds) can deliver. Related: Should I move half of my savings into an annuity? That doesn't mean you have to invest all, or even most, of your savings in stocks. Even a small dollop of stocks, as little as 30% or so, can provide enough return potential to substantially reduce the risk of outliving your savings compared with an all-cash equivalents portfolio. Which means you should have plenty of leeway for finding a mix of stocks and bonds that can get you the retirement income you need without subjecting your nest egg to wild swings in value. You can get an idea of what stocks-bonds mix might be right for you (and how different mixes have fared in the past) by completing this risk tolerance-asset allocation questionnaire. To see how long your nest egg might last at different withdrawal rates and with various combinations of stocks and bonds, check out this retirement income calculator. Up to this point, we've been talking probabilities of how long you might be able to draw a given amount of income from savings, not certainties. But there is a way to create income that's guaranteed to last as long as you do: buy an annuity. Granted, annuities can be complex and confounding. But there is one type that, relative to other annuities at least, is fairly easy to understand: an immediate annuity. You turn over a lump sum of savings to an insurer and in return get monthly payments for life. Today, for example, a 65-year-old man who invests $100,000 in an immediate annuity would receive about $550 a month for life; a 65-year-old woman would get $530 a month; and a 65-year-old couple (man and woman) would receive about $470 a month as long as either is alive. (This annuity calculator can show you how much income you'd receive based on your age, sex and amount invested.) But even this relatively straightforward annuity comes with conditions you need to understand, one of the most significant being that in return for guaranteed income for life you typically give up all or most access to the money you've invested. Which is one reason I think anyone who feels they might want more guaranteed income than Social Security alone will provide should consider this two-pronged strategy: Invest enough of your savings in an annuity so that the annuity's payments along with income from Social Security and any pensions will cover all or most essential expenses; then invest the rest in an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds and cash you can draw on as needed to pay any additional expenses. If such a strategy appeals to you, be sure to check out these tips for choosing an annuity before committing to one. Given the wariness expressed in your question, you may very well decide that even a relatively conservative mix of stocks and bonds — in conjunction with an annuity or not — isn't right for you. And that's fine. I'm sure you won't have trouble finding advisers suggesting plenty of other ways to go. Remember, though, that any realistic strategy to convert savings to sustainable retirement income will necessarily involve trade offs and compromises, not mention varying levels of fees. Just make sure that before you sign on, you know exactly what those trade offs, compromises and fees are.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150707170742-nest-egg-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/21/retirement/supplement-social-security/index.html?section=money_retirement|5 income strategies to supplement Social Security in retirement|Social Security is only designed to replace about 40% of the average retiree's income, leaving two options — either dramatically reduce your standard of living, or create additional income from other sources. While annuities are certainly one way to create an income stream, there are some downsides to this popular approach. Specifically, annuities often have high fees, and better returns can often be achieved elsewhere. With that in mind, here are five retirement income strategies that could be smart options for you to supplement your monthly Social Security checks. Reverse mortgages As the name implies, a reverse mortgage works in the opposite manner of a traditional mortgage. Instead of making monthly payments to a bank and building equity in your home, the bank makes payments to you in exchange for your equity. Reverse mortgages are available to homeowners 62 and older who own enough equity in their home to justify the loan. Upon obtaining a reverse mortgage, the lender makes payments to you and interest begins to accumulate on the outstanding balance. However, you'll never have to pay back the reverse mortgage unless you sell your home. Reverse mortgages are generally paid off through the sale of a home, either during the borrower's lifetime or after death. To be clear, there are some downsides to reverse mortgages. Even so, in many cases, reverse mortgages can be a smart way to create an income stream without touching your retirement nest egg. Bond laddering When it comes to creating retirement income, I'm a fan of maintaining a properly allocated investment portfolio of stocks and bonds. We'll get to stock investing later, but there are some basic problems with bond investing, especially that bonds pay extremely low interest rates on a historical basis. The concept of a bond ladder can help you still get current income, while also allowing yourself to boost your future income if rates rise. Here's a simplified explanation of how a bond ladder might work. Let's say that you have $100,000 to invest, so instead of putting it all in 10-year bonds, you would put 20% in bonds that mature in two years, another 20% in four-year bonds, and so on. The result is that you'll get the higher income of some longer-dated bonds, but every two years, you'll have $20,000 to put to work at the then-current long-term rates. Buy, start, or invest in a small business This is the most "outside-the-box" way to create retirement income on the list, but it has become more popular recently. For example, a retired couple who plans to retire to a beach town might buy a bed and breakfast. The "buy a business" route can be an especially good option because it can help cure another issue commonly encountered in retirement — boredom. Operating a business can keep you active and engaged. There are clearly some downsides of this option. For example, owning your business can be a risky way to make money, and not all retirees are physically capable of running a business. However, this is an interesting option for entrepreneurial-minded retirees. Real estate Investing in real estate can produce excellent income, and can also increase your net worth over time. And thanks to the power of leverage (mortgage financing), retirees don't necessarily need a ton of money to get started. There are several risks to be aware of. Vacancies, bad tenants, and unexpected maintenance issues are just a few of the uncertainties. However, for many people, the reward potential can definitely outweigh the risk. In fact, investing in rental properties is a big part of my own retirement planning strategy. Dividend growth investing Last, but certainly not least, stock investing can be an excellent way to generate a growing income stream in retirement. A smart approach for retirees is to focus on dividend growth stocks — in other words, stocks that not only pay dividends, but have a solid history of increasing their dividend payments. For example, Procter & Gamble has an above-average 3.7% dividend yield and has increased its payout for 62 consecutive years. Stocks like this pay more than you can get from many intermediate-term investment-grade bonds, with the added probability of rising income over time. If you aren't comfortable with choosing individual stocks, you can invest in diverse assortments of these companies through mutual funds and ETFs.

The best choice for you depends on your risk tolerance, the level of involvement you want to have, and other factors. While it's likely that not all these suggestions are ideal for you, my point is to get you thinking about alternatives before putting your retirement nest egg into an annuity or other fixed-income strategy.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160523193856-high-net-worth-survey-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/17/retirement/annuities-retirement-plan/index.html?section=money_retirement|Do annuities belong in your retirement plan?|On the surface, annuities may seem like an incredibly enticing "investment" to consider as part of your retirement plan. Insurance companies dangle promises of market-like returns on the upside with no risk of loss during your accumulation years and guaranteed income during your distribution years to get you to sign up for them. When you dig beneath that surface, you often find that the promises offered by annuities in their marketing wind up severely limited by things like caps, participation rates, and internal fund costs. Over time, those limits mean that you'll very likely wind up better off investing directly in the market via index funds than investing via an annuity. As a result, while you're accumulating money for retirement, annuities generally don't belong in your retirement plan. Do annuities ever make sense? Still, despite the fact that annuities usually make lousy investing vehicles, they can provide reasonable insurance benefits in the form of guaranteed income during retirement. Simple, straightforward single premium immediate annuities from strong insurance companies can provide people with the peace of mind of knowing they won't run out of money in retirement. Simple annuities like that can work out for retirees who aren't comfortable managing their own money. After all, the risks of a poor withdrawal strategy from an investment portfolio could leave a retiree without income at a time when that retiree has no realistic way of earning a living through work. Still, even the best of annuities have drawbacks that you should recognize before you commit to using them at all. First, any annuity is only as good as the financial strength of its issuer. If the insurance company offering your annuity were to declare bankruptcy, you would be dependent on the limits and funding sufficiency of your state's insurance backstop program to provide you any income. In addition, any option offered by the annuity company beyond the basics of a simple income stream for either a guaranteed time period or for your life will likely come at a substantial cost. Want inflation protection? That will cost you. Want to assure your heirs will get something after you pass? You're likely better off leaving that something outside your annuity than asking the insurance company to handle it for you. Don't forget the biggest annuity you probably already have In addition, if you work in the United States, chances are that you already have access to a retirement plan that acts very much like an annuity that offers you an inflation-protected income for life. It's called Social Security, and even in the worst case scenario where nothing gets done to shore up the program, it's expected to cover around three-quarters of its promised benefits for retirees. The typical retiree or retired couple receives enough from Social Security to keep out of abject poverty. While Social Security alone won't let you live a lifestyle of the rich and famous, it's fair to ask how much guaranteed income you really need above Social Security. Other than health-related costs, most retirees find that their expenses actually go down when they're retired. If you don't need additional guaranteed income, you might be better off with the greater flexibility that you get outside of annuities. Remember, too, that even Social Security's promises are expensive to provide. The combined employee and employer tax rate is 12.4% of your income up to $128,400 of income, and it takes 35 years of those taxes on your earnings to qualify for your full expected benefit. Guarantees, are not cheap, no matter whether they come from the government or from an insurance company. The typical recipient of those guarantees will ultimately be the one paying for that guarantee. Know their role -- and limit the bells and whistles If you consider them only for the portion of your finances that really needs the guaranteed income they promise, annuities may make some sense as part of your retirement plan. Just be sure to treat them as the insurance plans that they are, and understand that just like with life insurance, the act of mixing investing and insurance in the same annuity plan is rarely a good idea for you.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/16/retirement/buying-an-annuity/index.html?section=money_retirement|4 steps you should take when buying an annuity|I would like to buy an immediate annuity, but I want to know that I'm getting one from a reliable company. How can I do that?—David H. Assuming you've already determined that putting some of your nest egg into an immediate annuity makes sense, you're absolutely right to want to be sure you're dealing with an insurance company that's financially sound. But while identifying a reliable insurer is a good start when converting savings to guaranteed retirement income, it's only that — a good start. Which is why if you really want to ensure that the portion of your savings you "annuitize" will be able to generate income you can count on no matter how long you live and regardless of how the financial markets perform, you should consider taking the following four steps: Step # 1: Look for insurers with high financial strength ratings When you buy an immediate annuity, you're essentially buying an insurer's promise to provide you with guaranteed income for life. So while you certainly want to choose an annuity that offers a competitive payout, you also want to choose one that's issued by an insurance company that has the financial wherewithal to back up its commitment to deliver that income. But unless you also happen to be a financial analyst, sussing out which insurers are best positioned to do that is likely more than you can manage on your own. Fortunately there's an easier way: limit yourself to insurance companies that receive high financial strength ratings — I'd generally say A+ or better — from ratings firms like A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's. To be sure, there's no guarantee that an insurance company's rating won't slip over time. But when it comes to buying income you'll be counting on for decades to come, it's just common sense to go with insurers that ratings firms have judged as having greater resources and flexibility to meet their financial obligations than their lower-rated peers. You can get an idea of how much immediate annuities are paying in general — as well as get quotes from specific insurers along with their financial strength ratings — by going to this annuity calculator. Step #2: Spread your annuity stash around Just as you wouldn't put all of your money in a single stock or bond, so it makes sense to diversify the portion of your nest egg you decide to invest in an immediate annuity. But you don't have to spread your money among dozens of companies, as you would when investing in stocks and bonds. That would be overkill. Splitting your investment among the annuities of two or more highly rated insurers ought to give you sufficient security. The main idea, though, is that you don't want to have all of your annuity income riding on the fortunes of just one insurance company, even if that insurer has a lofty financial strength rating. Step #3: Don't invest too much with any single insurer There's a relatively easy way to gain yet another layer of protection for your retirement income: Limit the amount you invest with any single insurer to the coverage limit offered by your state guaranty association. Although the state insurance guaranty system operates differently than the FDIC's federal deposit insurance program, it's similar in that it provides a safety net of sorts for owners of insurance policies and annuities in the event an insurer becomes insolvent. The maximum amount of coverage varies by state, but ranges between $100,000 to $500,000 for annuities. (You can get details about how this system works and find the coverage limits for your state by going to the National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations' site.) The coverage limits are per insurer, which means most people should be able to fairly easily ensure that their entire annuity investment is simultaneously covered by their state's guaranty system as well as spread among highly rated insurers. For example, even if you plan to annuitize, say, $300,000 of savings and your state guaranty association's coverage limit is $150,000, you could get full protection by splitting your annuity investment among two or more highly rated insurers. Step 4: Invest gradually rather than all at once The size of the annuity payment you'll receive depends not just on your age and sex, but also on the level of interest rates when you buy. All else equal, the higher interest rates are, the higher your payment. You can't control interest rates, or predict their path for that matter. But by buying in stages — say, annuitizing $300,000 with separate $100,000 purchases over a few years rather than investing the entire three hundred grand in one shot — you can at least diversify against the risk of putting all your money into annuities when interest rates are at a low. There's another reason to buy in stages rather than jumping in all at once. It's not always obvious early in retirement how much income you'll require to cover your expenses and how much guaranteed income, if any, you'll want beyond what you'll already be getting from Social Security and any pensions. By investing smaller amounts over a period of a few years, you'll be able to periodically re-assess your spending needs and, in so doing, reduce the risk that you'll end up with more guaranteed income than you actually need .|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180404142215-money-moves-investing-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/retirement/best-annuities/index.html?section=money_retirement|What are the best annuities for you?|An old saying among investors is that annuities aren't bought, they're sold. This is because annuities often are very complex, very expensive financial products that carry heavy commissions for the advisers who sell them. Unfortunately, that saying is frequently very, very true. Annuities are insurance products that are frequently marketed for their investment-like features. In general, the more complicated a product is, the more expensive it winds up being — either through direct costs and fees or through cases of "the large print giveth, the small print taketh away." As a result, if you're considering an annuity, your best bet is to keep yourself focused on why you need the annuity and what features of that annuity really matter to you. Why buy an annuity? The best reason to consider buying an annuity is because you have money set aside for your retirement but have no interest or ability to manage that money. For instance, if you've worked your entire career without thinking about investing, and then you get a lump-sum distribution from your retirement plan at work, you might be a candidate for an annuity. Alternatively, if your spouse always took care of the household finances but is no longer able to, an annuity may be right for you. Still, even if you fit into one of these categories, you should know what you're getting into and the downsides of even the best-designed annuity. For one, it's only as good as the financial strength of the insurance company issuing it. If the insurance company goes bankrupt, you're at the mercy — and limits — of the state's insurance-guarantee program for any potential recovery. For another, in most cases, annuities promise to pay you for a certain amount of time — and that's it. Frequently, that amount of your time is either for your life, the longer of your life or your spouse's, or a specific calendar duration. If you want to leave an inheritance to your children, your alma mater, or your favorite charity, you either can't do it with your annuity or it will cost you significantly to do so. The simplest is usually the best In most cases, the simplest form of annuity is the best to buy — the one known as a single premium immediate annuity. As the name implies, you make a one-time investment in the annuity and the annuity company begins immediately (or possibly, the very next month) paying you a monthly income. A key reason these annuities are often the best is because they're the simplest, and thus the easiest to compare across providers. Because single premium immediate annuities are so easy to comparison shop, annuity companies often offer solid and competitive deals on those straightforward plans. Part of their hope is to establish their reputations for "fair dealing" with their customers, and then upsell you on a more complex (and likely profitable for them) offering. The big benefit for you is that you can turn your lump sum of cash into a reliable, predictable income stream that can potentially last the rest of your life. A key thing to watch out for, though, is that as soon as you get beyond a plain vanilla contract — such as adding inflation protection, second-to-die rights, or a guarantee your estate will get back at least what you paid into it — the costs start adding up. The insurance company knows that most annuity buyers want those features — and is happy to charge to provide them. In a similar vein, you often can find a reasonable deal on another form of straightforward annuity known as a single premium deferred annuity. With this type of annuity, you also make a one-time investment and the annuity starts paying out that monthly income at some agreed-upon time in the future. These can be useful if you have temporary income early in your retirement — such as a severance benefit or proceeds from a deferred-compensation plan — but will need the income in a few years. The key trick to shopping deferred annuities is to keep it simple there, as well. Once you start getting past the plain vanilla promise of a fixed payout starting at a specific date in the future, different plans and providers get tough to compare — and the costs can really add up. For instance, many annuity providers will steer their deferred annuity customers toward variable annuities. Those offer the potential of higher returns while you accumulate money, followed by a guaranteed payout based on the unknown future value of your account once you annuitize. Be careful what you're buying The danger to you is that once you get into the realm of variable deferred annuities, the insurance companies start to stack the deck in their favor. For instance, if they offer "stock-market-like returns," they often have "participation rates" or other caps that limit the total percentage you can earn on the upside when the stock market does well.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/retirement/bond-ladder/index.html?section=money_retirement|How to replace income with a bond ladder|The biggest challenge that retirees face at the end of their careers is how to make ends meet financially without a paycheck. Social Security provides basic income to millions of retirees, but it's important for those who've successfully set aside money in retirement savings to invest well and make their investments work as hard as possible for them. After retirement, many investors turn away from the stock market toward less volatile fixed-income securities, such as bonds and bank CDs. One strategy that involves using bonds or CDs can help you ensure that you'll have set amounts of income ready for you at fixed intervals throughout your retirement, while also giving you flexibility if it turns out that you don't need as much income as you had initially projected. This strategy, known as a bond ladder, is easy to use and can also help you boost how much income you get from your portfolio. How bond ladders work The bond ladder strategy involves building up a portfolio of multiple bonds that fit with your investment needs. To set up the initial bond ladder, you can buy a large set of bonds that mature at different times, typically investing equal amounts that match up with your anticipated expenses. Alternatively, you can invest in smaller groups of bonds at regular intervals, gradually building the whole bond portfolio rather than seeking to do so all at once. An example can make bond laddering easier to understand. Say you have $100,000 in retirement savings in 2018 and anticipate needing to replace $20,000 of income each year over the next five years. To build a bond ladder, you could invest $20,000 in a bond that matures in 2019, $20,000 in a bond maturing in 2020, and equal $20,000 amounts in bonds maturing in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Alternatively, you could invest just a quarter of your $100,000 total right now in one- to five-year bonds, and then invest another $25,000 three months from now in five bonds with maturities from one to five years. You'd then repeat the process six months from now and nine months from now to be fully invested. The advantages of bond ladders There are two key benefits of bond ladders. First, if you anticipate spending down all of your savings according to a set plan, then the bond ladder ensures that you'll have the money you'll need when you need it. Strictly speaking, if you know you'll need a fixed amount several years from now, you can even invest a bit less than the full amount now, because you can count on the interest that the bonds pay to help you reach your target. It's usually safer to go ahead and invest the full amount now if you can, because that way, the interest can help offset any erosion in the purchasing power of your money from inflation over the period. Bond ladders are also beneficial when you don't expect to spend down every penny of your savings. That's because when a bond comes due on your bond ladder, you can reinvest whatever money you don't need right away in a new bond that matures after the last bond in your current portfolio. For instance, in the example above, when the first one-year bond matures in 2019, you could take any amount remaining and invest it in a new five-year bond that will mature in 2024, a year after the five-year bond you initially purchased matures in 2023. Because longer-term bonds tend to pay higher interest rates, bond laddering can boost the total amount of income you're able to get in interest payments from your investment portfolio. The downsides of bond ladders Despite their advantages, bond ladders aren't perfect. Traditionally, bonds haven't had as good returns as the stock market has provided, and so for those who need their money to grow during retirement, bond ladders aren't the ideal solution for all of your investment capital. In other words, you end up paying for the certainty that bond ladders provide by giving up some potential return on your investment. More importantly, bond ladders lock you into a set of assumptions about when you'll need your money, and it can be difficult or costly to get at your money before that if circumstances change. If you use traditional bonds for a bond ladder, then market-price changes can result in a loss of principal if you try to get at your money early. Some people use bank CDs instead of regular bonds in order to eliminate this market risk, but in that case, you can end up paying a penalty for early withdrawal that forfeits the interest that your CD generated over a certain period of time.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/08/pf/fixed-or-adjustable-rate-mortgage/index.html?section=money_realestate|Should I get a fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgage?|You've been dreaming of owning a home for years, and now you're finally ready to make the leap. You've found the perfect place and may have even started deciding where to put the furniture, but you still have one big obstacle standing in your way: getting a mortgage. If you've never bought a home before, the whole process can seem a little confusing. One of the first things you have to figure out is whether you should get a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage. Most people choose the fixed-rate mortgage without even thinking about it, but there are situations where an adjustable-rate mortgage may be a better fit. How fixed-rate mortgages work Every mortgage charges interest in order to make the deal worth it for lenders. With fixed-rate mortgages, you lock in a single interest rate for the lifetime of your loan. Usually, the payment period is 30 years, but it can be 20 or 15 if you want to pay off your home more quickly. The reason fixed-rate mortgages are so popular is that they're more predictable. You know exactly how much money to set aside out of your paycheck each month to cover the bill. Plus, if interest rates rise, you don't have to worry about your monthly mortgage payment rising accordingly. The disadvantage is that if mortgage rates go down and you'd like to capitalize on this, you'll have to refinance — and that means spending a few thousand dollars in closing costs. Fixed-rate mortgages also have higher starting interest rates than adjustable-rate mortgages, and that may limit how much home you're able to buy. How adjustable-rate mortgages work As the name implies, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have interest rates that change over the lifetime of the loan. Most ARMs these days are hybrids, which means they have an initial fixed-rated period, after which the interest rate begins to change, usually once per year. You may see this written as 5/1 or 7/1. This means that you get five or seven years of a fixed interest rate, and after that, the interest rate — and your payments — will be adjusted every year. The risks of ARMs are clear. When your interest rate can change, it's possible that your payments could become so expensive that you can't keep up with them. If your monthly payments during the initial fixed-rate period would put a strain on your budget, an ARM isn't a good choice for you. Before taking out an ARM, be sure to get a Truth in Lending disclosure from your lender, which should list the maximum amount your monthly mortgage payment could reach. Make sure you're comfortable with this amount before you sign on the dotted line. But there can be times when an ARM is the smarter choice. Starting interest rates on ARMs are usually lower than on fixed-rate mortgages, so your monthly payments will likely be lower for at least a few years. And if you find yourself in an environment where mortgage interest rates are declining or holding steady, your interest rates may not increase significantly even after the fixed-rate period is up. If interest rates begin to decline, your monthly payments may actually decrease, though not all ARMs allow this, and they often put a cap on how low your payments can go. Typically there are also caps on how much your payments can increase, both annually and over the lifetime of the loan. You may see this written as 2/2/5 or something similar. The first number reflects the greatest amount by which the interest rate can rise in the first year after your fixed-rate period ends — in this case, 2%. The second number represents the most it can change every year thereafter, and the third number represents the most it can change over the lifetime of your loan. Related: More on buying a home To put this in perspective, let's say you buy a $250,000 home with a 30-year 5/1 ARM, a 4% initial interest rate, and 20% down. Your initial monthly payment would be $955. In an ideal world, that number wouldn't increase over the lifetime of the loan, and you'd get the whole house for about $344,000, factoring in interest. However, that's nearly the best-case scenario. Now let's consider the worst-case scenario. Imagine that, after the initial fixed-rate period, your interest rate rose by 0.25% each year until it reached the maximum increase of 5%, bringing your interest rate to 9%. You'd end up paying $419,000 over the lifetime of the loan, and your monthly payment would climb to $1,323. These are extreme scenarios, and in reality, the price you ultimately paid for your home would likely fall somewhere in the middle. However, you should keep in mind that if your ARM's interest rate reaches its cap, it could cost you tens of thousands of dollars in additional interest payments. Which type of mortgage is right for me? Fixed-rate mortgages are usually the better choice for most people. This is especially true if you plan on being in your home for more than five years or if interest rates are historically low, as they are now.

Before you sign up for an ARM, though, it's important to calculate how much your mortgage payment could change over the lifetime of your loan to make sure it's still something you could afford.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/130509152135-house-for-sale-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/21/news/companies/toll-brothers-housing-market/index.html?section=money_realestate|Toll Brothers' record shows the American housing boom has no end in sight|Unemployment keeps falling and home prices keep going up. It's a great recipe for a strong housing market. Nothing has been able to stop the housing boom -- not even higher interest rates. Luxury home builder Toll Brothers (TOL) said Tuesday that demand for its houses was strong across the country -- the company signed a record number of contracts last quarter. Toll Brothers reported quarterly financial results that easily topped forecasts and raised its outlook for the year, citing a backlog of new homes for the third quarter. Higher rates do not seem to be an issue for prospective buyers, mainly because the job market remains strong and housing prices are rising. The company said that the average price of its homes in the most recent quarter was $851,900, compared to $791,400 a year ago. And Toll Brothers expects that prices for the current quarter will range between $840,000 and $870,000. The only weak spot was California, where demand cooled a bit. Toll Brothers executive chairman Robert Toll said the company believes the new home market can continue to grow in the coming years -- especially as people seek to cash in on the rising value of their current home and trade up. As the value of people's homes increases, empty nesters and homeowners looking for bigger houses have more equity to work with, Toll said in the company's press release. He also expects those two groups and Millennials will fuel demand for new homes in the coming years. Shares of Toll Brothers surged more than 11% on the solid earnings Tuesday -- but the stock is still down 20% for the year. The results are the latest sign that the recent homebuilder stock slump may have been an overreaction. Investors feared that rate hikes would weaken demand for homes. That hasn't happened yet. Rival builder Lennar (LEN) also reported healthy quarterly results in late June. Retail giant Home Depot (HD) just posted strong numbers last week as well, another sign that people continue to spend on their houses. Home Depot rival Lowe's (LOW) will report results Wednesday and analysts are expecting a nearly 30% jump in earnings.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180821092019-toll-brothers-home-780x439.jpg

Enter your details below to figure out what you might pay each month. Why use this calculator? Looking to buy a home? It’s important to take out a mortgage that you can reasonably afford. A mortgage is a home loan that is usually paid back in fixed amounts over a period of time – typically 15 or 30 years. Each payment includes a portion that goes toward the mortgage principle, and another portion that goes toward interest charged by the lender. Most experts recommend that your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 35% of your gross income. But that is the upper end. Other models are more conservative and suggest 25%, in order to keep your debt-to-income ratio lower. A middle-ground recommendation says you shouldn’t put more than 28% of your monthly gross income toward your mortgage payment. And don’t forget to consider additional costs associated with owning a home, such as utilities, taxes, maintenance, which will add to your monthly costs. This calculator can help you determine what your monthly payments will be, based on how much money you plan to borrow for your home purchase.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images//i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210212160758-mortgage-signing---stock-story-top.jpg?q=w_800,c_fill
http://money.cnn.com/2018/07/17/real_estate/real-estate-in-europe/index.html?section=money_realestate|Real estate in Europe is booming|There's a nice little real estate boom underway in Europe. Europe took 11 of the top 20 spots on a ranking of cities with the largest price increases in the first quarter, according to global property agency Knight Frank. Prices spiked more than 14% over the previous year in Berlin, Rotterdam and Budapest. EU data back up the findings, showing that home prices increased by an average of 4.7% across the bloc in the first quarter, the highest price growth since late 2007 when the global financial crisis was about to explode. Demand has been fueled by low interest rates, an improving job market, rising consumer confidence and growing interest from foreign buyers, according to Kate Everett-Allen, a residential property expert at Knight Frank. At the same time, the number of new homes being built has slumped. "There's a massive reduction in what's coming out of the ground in terms of new dwellings," said Everett-Allen. One prime example of the trend is Spain, where only 55,000 new homes were built in 2016. That compares to 735,000 in 2006, before the country's economy was rocked by a debt crisis. Everett-Allen said that prices have increased 10% in Madrid, making it one of the strongest growth areas. "Madrid is a key one," she said. "The economy has improved significantly. A lot of commercial activity is feeding into the residential side ... You're seeing interest from European buyers and some from Latin America as well." Related: Is this the future of home renovation? Dublin is also bouncing back after a major property bubble burst during the financial crisis. Prices there jumped nearly 12% in the first quarter. "Prices [in places like Ireland and Spain] are still below their pre-crisis peak," said Everett-Allen. "They're rising from quite a low base." Small is beautiful Europe is also seeing a "small-city renaissance" due to increasing interest from young buyers, said Paul Tostevin, associate director at real estate agency Savills. "Compared to higher-cost, congested global mega-cities, historic European cities on a smaller footprint offer residents shorter commutes, a lower cost of living and high quality of life," he said. There are some outliers. EU data show that prices in Italy and some Nordic nations are slipping. Knight Frank estimates that prices in Turin dropped 7.1% in the first quarter. London's famously expensive housing market has also experienced price declines as Brexit and new taxes have scared off buyers. Related: American prices are rising faster than they have in six years Changes in monetary policy could constrain future demand. The European Central Bank has announced plans to end its €2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) stimulus program and it could hike interest rates as early as 2019, making mortgages more expensive. Everett-Allen said buyers may be trying to lock in purchases before rates go up, contributing to the current market strength.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180713120404-berlin-city-real-estate-property-germany-780x439.jpg

But the company is not content only serving real estate voyeurs. It wants a bigger piece of the housing market pie. Investors, however, are not pleased. Shares of Zillow (Z) plunged nearly 20% Tuesday after it announced a plan to buy Mortgage Lenders of America, a home loan bank based in Kansas. Zillow also reported earnings and disappointed investors with its revenue outlook late Monday. The bank deal is not the first move from Zillow into home buying. The company announced in April that it was looking to purchase and flip homes near Phoenix and Las Vegas. But the purchase of Mortgage Lenders of America will help Zillow originate and underwrite loans for homebuyers, a lucrative market that is currently dominated by big banks. "We expect to be operating a larger and stronger business that is integrated into the consumer's entire home life cycle," said CEO Spencer Raskoff during a conference call with analysts Monday. Related: Flip this house! ZIllow plans to buy and sell homes Analysts are concerned by the aggressive push into the mortgage business. "There are more questions than answers at this point," said Brent Thill of Jefferies. He said the company "tripped over its own shoelaces out of the gate" with the mortgage move. Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler downgraded Zillow's stock Tuesday because of "greater concerns" about the push into mortgage lending. Nonetheless, Raskoff seems convinced that Zillow has to become a bigger part of the housing market. "These are all large and expanding markets in which we will now be active participants, not simply a place to advertise," Raskoff added. The timing of the move could be adding to concerns from investors. Mortgage rates have been creeping higher lately and should continue to go up. The Federal Reserve currently plans to raise interest rates two more times this year and several more times in 2019. That has led to some fears that the housing market may be close to peaking. Investors have shunned most housing related stocks this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) exchange-traded fund, which owns shares of big builders like Lennar (LEN), retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) and appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR), is down nearly 10% so far in 2018.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180807102319-zillow-stock-down-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/20/real_estate/new-york-city-rents/index.html?section=money_realestate|Is Manhattan's rental market finally cooling off?|Renting in Manhattan is notoriously expensive. But lately it's becoming just a little bit more affordable ... a little. Prices have been on a general decline this year as more apartments become available, and landlords continue to make concessions. Rental prices declined for the first four months of the year, according to market reports by real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman Real Estate. In March, rental prices dropped 3% from a year earlier to $3,400. Luxury apartments have seen the biggest price drops. Rentals with three bedrooms or more have seen a nearly 6% annual drop in May, while rents on two-bedroom units are down 4.6%, the latest report found. Last month, overall prices crept up 0.6%, partly because the summer ushers in a flood of new renters and there was a jump in bigger apartments hitting the market. "End of September and October, when the last wave of students and transfers move in, probably the first thing we will see is incentives increasing and then from there, prices dropping," said Nathan Tondow, managing broker at Zumper in New York City. "For any renters looking, if they look in August versus February, the same one-bedroom apartment is probably $200 more in summer." Related: Why West Coast home prices are surging Concessions have been kicking into high gear this year — up 12.5% year over year and have been rising for three years, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel. Apartment listings are currently enticing tenants with incentives like two months of free rent, reduced security deposits and paid broker's fees. Landlords have also been more open to negotiations when it comes to keeping current tenants, according to Hal Gavzie, executive manager of leasing at Douglas Elliman. "Landlords are being much more aggressive to keep current tenants renewing and they are negotiating those rents. Maybe a year ago they would have been increasing it by a certain amount, but now they are either keeping flat or reducing," said Gavzie. The main reason for the rent drops and rise in concessions is a flood of new inventory, giving renters more choice. In the past three years, around 19,000 new units have hit the market in Manhattan, according to Nadia Balint, data analyst at Yardi Matrix. Another 10,000 units are under construction and 27,000 more are in the planning stages. That new inventory will continue to tilt the market to favor renters even more. "An increase in new apartments waiting to be filled means renters are in the position to negotiate upfront price cuts. This has all the signs of a renter's market," said Balint. While luxury rentals have seen the biggest discounts, that usually trickles down to other price levels as well. Construction costs are high in New York City, so builders tend to focus on projects that will generate the biggest profit. "If the top is the softest, it melts into the next layer," said Miller. "All of the sudden, now you have an older rental competing for the same-size new apartment that also has a rock wall, a pool, and other amenities for the same price, so then those rents soften." Related: Home prices are on an epic run New York isn't the only city with a slowing rental market. Other larger coastal cities, including Boston, San Francisco and Washington, DC, saw rental prices flatline, according to Balint. The national average rent increased 2% in May, the slowest season start since 2010, she added. The top 25 fastest growing rental markets in the country were small cities, thanks to strong local job markets, economic growth and population migration. Rent prices in Detroit increased the most among the nation's largest cities in May, followed by Las Vegas and Denver. "Affordable migration has something to do with it, and when a company relocates to a lower taxed state or a more affordable market where land is cheaper, it brings in new jobs in certain markets, so if local economies are strong, the real estate market starts to grow as well," said Balint.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150611130659-manhattan-apartment-window-view-780x439.jpg

Tell us a little about your finances and the type of property you’re looking to buy to get a sense of what you can afford. Why use this calculator? Before you start shopping for a new home, you need to determine how much house you can afford. One way to start is to get pre-approved by a lender, who will look at factors such as your income, debt and credit, as well as how much you have saved for a down payment, to come up with loan amount you can afford. One rule of thumb is to aim for a home that costs about two-and-a-half times your gross annual salary. If you have significant credit card debt or other financial obligations like alimony or even an expensive hobby, then you may need to set your sights lower. Another general rule of thumb: All your monthly home payments should not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/26/investing/lennar-housing-market-home-building/index.html?section=money_realestate|Housing market remains strong, despite mortgage rate worries|The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, and that's led some to worry that mortgage rates will spike and put an end to the housing boom in the United States. Not so fast, according to the head of a big homebuilder. Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Miami-based builder Lennar, said Tuesday that "concerns about rising interest rates and construction costs have been offset by low unemployment and increasing wages." He added that there is still a "short supply" of houses on the market after "years of underproduction of new homes." And he said "demand remained strong" and "affordability remained consistent" thanks to rates that remain relatively low. Miller made those remarks in Lennar's earnings release Tuesday morning. The company reported revenue and profits that topped Wall Street's forecasts. Shares of Lennar (LEN) surged more than 7% on the news. Rival builders Pulte (PHM), DR Horton (DHI), Toll Brothers (TOL) and KB Home (KBH) all rose too. Lennar's results are an encouraging sign for the group, which has been hit hard this year on fears that higher interest rates will start to take a bite out of demand for new homes. Builder stocks have been hit hard this year, with many of them -- including Lennar -- falling more than 20% in 2018. Related: Why West Coast home prices are surging But Lennar's results and other recent data may be assuaging fears that the bottom is going to fall out of the housing market. The federal government said Monday that new home sales in May were better than expected, citing particular strength in the southern part of the US. That should be good news for the broader economy. Lewis Alexander, chief US economist at Nomura, said in a report Tuesday that he was raising his GDP estimate for the second quarter, citing the stronger home sales figures and expectations of higher broker commissions. And according to the closely watched S&P Case-Shiller index that was released Tuesday morning, home prices continued to rise across the country -- with 17 of the 20 cities tracked in the index registering increases. "Given the combination of strong demand and lean inventories, especially for existing homes, we expect home prices to continue appreciating at a modest pace for the remainder of the year," said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram in a report Tuesday. As long as the housing market remains stable, that should give consumers more confidence. To that end, the government reported strong retail sales figures for May earlier this month. And it was led by healthy gains at home-improvement stores like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). These chains tend to do well when people are looking to sell their home.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180626093340-housing-construction-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/13/real_estate/west-coast-housing-markets/index.html?section=money_realestate|Why West Coast home prices are surging|Housing markets out west are on fire. Prices are rising, supply is tight and competition among buyers is fierce. That's all good news for homeowners. Not so much for buyers. Home prices have risen faster than wages in many cities, creating an affordability issues for buyers — especially first timers. "Everything from the Rocky Mountain states and west from there are doing much better than the rest of the country and it's been like that quite consistently," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. Seattle, Las Vegas and San Francisco are leading the way with annual double-digit home price gains in March, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. Nationwide, price rose 6.5% during that period. Seattle has now seen nearly six years of positive annual price gains, with 27 consecutive months of double-digit gains. Related: It's really tough to be a homebuyer in Seattle During the peak years before the housing boom, it was the sunbelt states that were dominating home price appreciation, noted David Blitzer of S&P Dow Jones Indices. "Following the technology collapse in the stock market in 2000, people saw owning a house as a great investment, better by far than the stock market. The Sunbelt had an attractive climate, available land and reasonable housing. Job growth was less of a factor," he said. But now it's the rise of the tech sector that's helping to drive the surge. Strong economic growth and job creation are two main drivers of price increases. As good jobs bring new residents to a city, the strong demand for housing pushes prices up. Many markets on the West Coast have the trifecta right now. The tech boom has created strong talent pools, local economies are booming and there's not enough housing to fill the demand. Taxes could also play a factor in people moving west, according to Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. Washington state doesn't have an income tax, and Proposition 13 in California has reduced property tax rates on homeowners. "The East Coast has some of the highest tax rates in the country," she said. "Not just property, but also income taxes, and now with the new the tax changes, you can only deduct up to $10,000 on state and local taxes, so that's a doubly whammy." Low inventory means homes are selling fast, with West Coast buyers facing the toughest conditions. Denver buyers have to act the quickest: half of all homes were pending sale in just six days in April, according to Redfin. Homes in Seattle spend a median of seven days on the market. The number increases to nine days in San Jose, California, and Tacoma, Washington. Related: How to save $9,000 on your mortgage Rising home prices have been a boon to homeowners. Nationwide, the average homeowner gained $16,300 in home equity from the first three months of 2017 to the same time this year, according to a recent report from CoreLogic. Owners in the West saw the largest increases. California homeowners got a bump of $51,000 in home equity, on average. And in Washington the average increase was around $44,000. When prices become too high they can push people to move to cities with more affordable housing. High prices can also cause businesses to relocate or re-think plans to open shop. "In places like San Jose and San Francisco, even a starter home can cost more than $1 million," Yun said. "I am not sure they can attract high talent over time. You may begin to see the copy cat effect of other cities trying to replicate high tech sector areas."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180613100620-san-francisco-coast-housing-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/real_estate/homeowner-costs/index.html?section=money_realestate|What to spend money on (and what to DIY) as a new homeowner|After the thrill of buying a new home wears off, new owners can get overwhelmed thinking about all the new costs incurred. You may be tempted to outsource it all. But maybe you're not made of money? Besides, there are things that are worth doing yourself. "If you want to DIY changing out the vanity in your bathroom, okay, but that may be above the average person's skill set and time," says Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angie's List, the home services site. "But do you know that you need to change your furnace filter once a month? And did you know that if you drain a quart of water out of your water heater every couple of months that will extend the life of your water heater?" Those are easy things to do yourself that can save you money, says Hicks. "But if you don't know what to do, you'll just end up having bigger expenses down the road because you're not taking care of things." For homeowners embarking on something new, it may not be clear what to take care of or how, and when to try to do it yourself and when to call the pros. Here are some of Hicks' guidelines. Do a home project inventory Hicks recommends taking an annual inventory of your home projects, independent of cost or time commitment. "When you are getting ready to buy a home, you look at it with a more critical eye than you ever will again," she says. "Once you're in it, you start thinking about your budget or you don't have the time." She suggests taking a day once a year to list all the projects you need to do. And then rank and categorize them: structural problems, mechanical problems, cosmetic issues, down to the wish list of a new kitchen or deck. Outsource jobs totally over your head Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your wheelhouse, especially if you fancy yourself a handy person. Hicks has some suggestions: "You shouldn't do electric work. And the worst enemy of your house is water, so don't DIY your plumbing, unless you know what you're doing." Another thing that's usually pretty affordable to outsource and can save you time and your health in the long run: anything on a ladder. "People are like, Oh yeah, I'll just clean out my gutter. This is a task anyone can do. I just have to climb up this ladder and scoop the leaves out. But if they don't have the right sized ladder, or a secure base, that's where injuries happen." Determine when to repair and when to replace One of the scariest things about homeownership is a financial surprise. So knowing the age and level of operation of systems in your house can help you anticipate upcoming costs. If you know your water heater is 15 years old, you might want to get it checked before committing to a brand new deck. "That's what makes a bad situation worse," says Hicks, "when something breaks and you're already committed." A good rule of thumb, Hicks says, is if your appliances are seven or eight years old and it will cost half as much to fix them as it will to replace them, replace them. "Because you'll end up nursing it along," she says. "And the new technology and efficiency of a new system can make total sense." Identify improvements that increase value Updating your home with smart technology — programmable thermostats or video doorbells — is a fairly easy DIY way to not only increase the home's value when it comes time to sell, but can deliver immediate savings on energy or security bills, says Hicks. "For $1,200 you can buy the most popular smart home technology," she says. "That could increase the value of your home by 5%." For larger, non DIY improvements, kitchen and bathroom remodels are always very popular and generally boost the value of your home. But be careful not to over-renovate, says Hicks. "When you think about remodeling, you want to keep up with the Jones's, not outdo them. You don't want to price yourself out of the neighborhood." When to outsource for time If outsourcing a task allows you to tackle a project or spend more time with important people in your life, then that's a good use of your time. But Hicks cautions that outsourcing these chores shouldn't turn into a stressful financial situation. You shouldn't go into debt outsourcing your lawn care or house cleaning. "If you're spending $50 or $60 to have your lawn mowed, you need to be okay with that as an expense you want to incur and endure every week for the 20 weeks of summer." When outsourcing, always negotiate Once you've concluded you're going to pay for a service, your work doesn't stop with the first service rep you meet. "It always can be a negotiation," says Hicks. "And don't rest on getting one estimate. Get two or three estimates. It gives you an opportunity to negotiate and also to see if you have an outlier." You should always have a contract in writing when paying someone to work on your home, she says. And she adds, the terms of the contract are also negotiable. Underplay your budget, too, she says.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/real_estate/house-flipping/index.html?section=money_realestate|He made $400,000 flipping a house|Earlier this year, Lin He made a $400,000 profit from a single home flip. The 3,600-square-foot house in Malibu was in foreclosure and was listed for $1.39 million. He purchased it for $985,000 in 2017 without ever stepping foot inside. "Boy, it was bad. It was a lot worse than I thought," he said. The renovations took three months and cost him around $300,000, plus he incurred many other costs like taxes, staging and realtor commissions. But it was worth it. He listed the home for $1.97 million — exactly double the price he paid for it. He got a full-price offer within three weeks of listing it. Home flipping increased to an 11-year high in 2017, according to data from ATTOM. That's roughly 6% of all home and condo sales. The rapid rise in home prices nationwide has made flipping more lucrative than it has been in recent years. The average gross return in the past three years was 50%, according to ATTOM. From 2004-2006, the average return on a flip was 31%. Related: Even rising mortgage rates won't stop homebuyers House flipping surged in popularity following the Great Recession, when prices bottomed out and some investors saw a buying opportunity. "At the bottom of market, you had professional investors well capitalized who were able to go in and scoop up deals with a lot of cash," said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at ATTOM. He, who'd been working in real estate for years, became an investor around that time. Between 2008-2014, He bought more than 100 homes. Some he flipped, others he kept in his rental portfolio. Many housing markets have seen prices return to pre-recession levels. Some have become so hot that prices increased by double digits. The epic rise caused He to hit pause on flipping in 2015 and start to deleverage. He sold off a portion of his rental portfolio and focused more on his design-build construction business. But when the Malibu home came up last year, it was too good of a deal to pass up. Related: Are you ready to buy a home? The ratio of flipped properties to sales nationwide was 6.2% for the first three months this year, according to CoreLogic, matching the post-crash high at the start of 2013. Banks and other institutional investors were heavy in the flipping market at that time, but these days more individuals are getting in on the action. "There are more of these bandwagon home flippers or novice home flippers jumping into the market because home prices are going up," noted Blomquist. But amateur flippers have their work cut out for them. The lack of inventory means prices are high and many are buying homes that need a lot of work, he added. High home prices are a double-edged sword, and the temptation is just too great for a lot of flippers. They see prices continuing to go up they can continue to make money even though buying at high price," said Blomquist. But flipping isn't as easy as it looks on TV. "It's not glamorous and it's real work, dealing with gross properties," said He. "It can have the potential to give you a good return on your money, but it's not as easy as people think."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180604110144-malibu-home-flip-kitchen-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/24/pf/how-to-lower-home-mortgage/index.html?section=money_realestate|How to save $9,000 on your mortgage|I want to buy my first house, but I live in an expensive area and I don't want to end up house poor. What can I do to lower my monthly mortgage payments?—Frank The leap into homeownership is a big change, especially on your finances. Buying a home is likely the biggest purchase you'll ever make, so it's important to keep your payments in line with what you can afford. When your mortgage eats up too much of your budget, it can affect your long-term financial security by limiting your ability to save for retirement, pay down debt or follow other dreams like traveling or starting a business. The general rule of thumb is to aim to have your monthly housing costs add up to less than 30% of your monthly before-tax income. No doubt that in the country's more expensive housing markets that's hard to do, but buyers can take steps to help reduce their housing payments. Improve your credit score Your credit score plays a major role with lenders in deciding the terms of your home loan (or whether they'll give you one at all). The better your score, the more likely you are to get a lower interest rate, which means you will be paying less over the life of your loan. A credit score of 750 and up is generally considered excellent and will make you the most attractive borrower. Calculate: How much home can your afford? Home buyers with credit scores below 620 tend to have very high interest rates and risky features on their home loans, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But a good credit score doesn't happen overnight. "It means that for a couple years before you really want to purchase a house, you start working to get your score as high as possible, said Nicole Theisen Strbich, a certified financial planner and director of financial planning with Buckingham Financial Group. "It's not a switch you can flip." Start by reviewing your credit report to identify outstanding debt and create a game plan on how to reduce it as quickly as possible. Be sure to also look for any errors on your report since they can take time to fix. Shop around ... a lot When it comes to getting a mortgage, it pays to shop around. The interest rate for similar loans can vary by more than half of one percentage point from one lender to another, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And while that number might sound small, it can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage. The difference between the average person's mortgage rate and the lowest rate available to them came to an extra $300 a year, a CFPB report found. That means paying an extra $9,000 over a 30-year mortgage. Get quotes from a variety of lenders, traditional banks, online-only banks and community banks to find the best rate, the experts advised. Don't worry about hurting your credit score: Multiple credit checks from mortgage lenders within a 45-day window are recorded on your credit report as a single inquiry. Related: 4 things first-time homebuyers need to know Put down a large down payment The larger your down payment, the less you need to borrow and the smaller your monthly mortgage payments will be. It also means paying less in total interest. If you can put down at least 20% of the home price, you can also avoid paying private mortgage insurance — which protects the lender in case you default — saving thousands of dollars a year. If you put more money down, you can also avoid paying points and other loan fees. While you're saving to hit that 20% mark, be sure to keep those funds safe. "If you are planning on purchasing in the next five years, save it in a place not subject to stock market volatility," recommended Strbich. "Find the highest interest-bearing account with FDIC insurance. Online banks are a great option for that." Think shorter The 30-year fixed rate mortgage is the most common home loan, but there are other options available. "I try to steer young people away from 30-year mortgages," said John Cooper, certified financial planner in South Carolina. "The extended maturity on the loan gives buyers a lower monthly payment, but it may in reality cause them to buy more of a home than they can afford." A 15-year mortgage comes with higher monthly payments, but also has a lower interest rate, which can bring significant savings. Related: Looking to buy your first home? Good luck with that Shorter loans also mean more of your payments are going toward the principal of your loan and less toward interest compared to a 30-year loan, so you'll build equity faster. For some buyers, an adjustable-rate mortgage could also make sense. ARMs offer a fixed, lower interest rate for a set period of time. But after that introductory period expires, the rate can rise (or drop) to current rates. So it's important to evaluate the risks and make sure your income will be able to cover a higher interest rate. Cooper said an ARM could work for buyers who know they won't be living in the home long term, or are in occupations where they aren't making a lot of money at the start, but will see a significant increase in a few years.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161116160614-housing-market-cities-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/16/pf/buying-a-home-seattle/index.html?section=money_realestate|It's really tough to be a homebuyer in Seattle|If you're hoping to buy a home in Seattle, be prepared for rejection. A lot of it. Homes frequently sell for well over asking and receive multiple offers. "For buyers, we are typically making six to 10 offers before we get a house," said Rob McGarty, who has been a real estate agent in Seattle for 14 years. "The amount of emotional energy going into preparing these offers is huge." Home prices in Seattle are on fire: rising nearly 13% in February from the same time a year ago, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. Prices have risen so fast that it's led to an affordability crisis, with no relief in site. "Seattle seems to be defying all the laws of housing market trends," said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at real estate data firm ATTOM. Related: Home prices are on an epic run The problem is simple: there are more people looking to buy homes than there are homes available for sale. Seattle's population has been rapidly growing recently thanks in part to its large homegrown businesses like Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX). Amazon in particular has played a major role in Seattle's economic growth and strength. The company employs more than 40,000 workers at its Seattle headquarters and pays out nearly $26 billion in compensation. "Amazon has amassed a huge talent pool of employees that has caused other companies to open offices here," said McGarty. "We have a ton of [San Francisco] Bay area companies that now have offices in Seattle ... those transplants have driven prices up." Home values in King County, which is where Amazon is located, have appreciated twice as fast as the national average, according to Blomquist. Average annual home price appreciation from 1995 (when Amazon first launched) to 2018 was 6%, according to ATTOM. Over the same time period, the national average was just 3%. Life as a buyer After months of online searching, open houses and having several offers rejected, Kayela Robertson and her husband, Cody, had hit their limit. She said it was common to see the homes they lost out on go on to sell for at least $100,000 over the asking price with multiple offers. They were about to expand their search radius when they made their seventh offer. "If we were going to be in Seattle, we had joked that we needed to get this house. This was the make it or break it offer," she said. "If we didn't, I would have to cave and move farther out." Fortunately, their seventh offer was accepted. To close the deal, they offered $140,000 more than the list price of $590,000. They also dropped all contingencies, included an escalation clause, put $100,000 in escrow and promised to close within two weeks. Related: Looking to buy your first home? Good luck with that The couple sold their home in Spokane in January for full asking price, and the money from the sale helped make their offer competitive. They closed on the new home a month ago. "The house we sold was much nicer and bigger and was much less [than the Seattle home]," Robertson said. "It is still an adjustment that we are paying more than two times more for this house." Where Seattle goes from here Despite being a seller's market, Seattle homeowners are hesitant to sell. Last year, the city was among the best markets to sell a home, and the average home seller return on investment was 64%, according to ATTOM. But even if they get a good price, sellers are struggling to find a home to trade up to. While the demand is clearly there, there's only so much room to build in Seattle. It's bounded by water and mountains. The city also has strict regulations when it comes to building apartment and condos, and 70% of the land mass in the city is zoned for single family homes, according to Matthew Gardner, chief economist at Windermere Real Estate. "We aren't very dense at all," he said. The home affordability problem could make the city less appealing to businesses. The city recently passed a new tax on big businesses that will help pay for affordable housing and fight homelessness. At some point, the housing affordability issues and high cost of living, plus the new business tax, could cause companies to think twice about starting or expanding in Seattle. "The two most important things when companies think about growing in a market is whether there is a suitable talent pool and how much they have to pay people, and the biggest part of salary is the local cost of living," said Gardner.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180515112347-seattle-homeowners-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/26/real_estate/ready-to-buy-a-home/index.html?section=money_realestate|Are you ready to buy a home?|Question: I am tired of paying rent and thinking about buying a home, but I'm worried about the added cost and responsibility. How do I know if I am ready?—Kate The transition from renter to homebuyer is a big one. Owning your own home gives you assurance that your monthly housing costs will never go up, (assuming you get a fixed-rate mortgage). Landlords can jack up your rent when you are least expecting it. But home ownership also comes with added responsibility. When something breaks in your rental unit, it's a quick call to the landlord to get it fixed. Homeowners are on the hook for both making and financing any repairs. It's a big financial leap to becoming a homeowner. Experts recommend asking yourself these questions before you start out house hunt: Do you know how much you can afford? Take the time to calculate how much home you can afford to buy. This isn't the time to ballpark numbers. Overcommitting to a mortgage payment can leave you house poor, meaning there's very little money left over at the end of the month for other things. Add up all your spending, including current rent, food, transportation and discretionary expenses like travel, eating out and entertainment Don't forget to include debts like student loans and car payments. Once you know how much you have coming in and going out each month, determine a number you can afford to spend on housing. Related: 5 ways to afford your first home Generally, personal finance experts recommend aiming to spend around 28% of your monthly income on housing. Getting pre-approved for a loan will also help give you a sense of your housing budget. But note that just because a bank agreed to give you a loan, doesn't mean you have to spend that much. "In my experience, [lenders] are always trying to get [buyers] to buy a home for more than they can afford or are comfortable with," said Francine Duke, a certified financial planner in the Chicago area and former mortgage underwriter. Do you have a down payment? You don't need a 20% down payment to get a loan. But putting more down can work in your favor. It can help you get better lending rates, beat out the competition in hot housing markets and will lower the amount of interest you pay over the life of a loan. You can get a mortgage with as little as a 3.5% down, but anything less than 20% means paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), which will increase your monthly payment. Working to save for a large down payment shows financial responsibility and gets you used to living on a strict budget. "When you really work to save enough to get 15%-20%, it shows you have a meaningful commitment," said Bill Van Sant, certified financial planner and senior vice president at Univest Wealth Management. Will you have money left over after closing? Your bank account shouldn't be zero after closing. You should still have an emergency savings fund that will cover around three to six months of living expenses on hand. Related: Home prices are on an epic run In addition to the emergency fund, Van Sant recommends having six to nine months of mortgage expenses available. "First-time homebuyers are typically looking at older homes because of their lower price point, and they require more work. You need that 'hanging around' money, in case the A/C or heater goes." Is your credit in good shape? You want to get your credit score as high as possible when shopping for a mortgage. The higher the score, the better the lending terms and rates. A credit score of 750 and up is generally considered excellent and will make you the most attractive borrower. Have you paid down other debts? Your debt-to-income ratio plays a major role in the health of your finances. You can calculate your debt-to-income ratio by adding up all your monthly debt payments and dividing it by your gross monthly income. The general rule of thumb is your debt should not exceed 43% of your available credit to take out a mortgage. Related: Even rising mortgage rates won't stop homebuyers Where do you see yourself in five years? If you don't plan on staying in an area for more than a couple of years, buying a house might not make financial sense. The huge upfront investment including the price of the home, plus the added costs like taxes, closing costs and escrow fees, might take a while to pay off. "Make sure you have roots there and will be staying," said Van Sant. "Some Millennials have no problem not being tied down to an area and jump around the country ... buying might not be the best bet if you don't plan on sticking around."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170405175306-home-for-sale-red-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/investing/home-depot-housing-market-earnings/index.html?section=money_realestate|Home Depot's sluggish sales may be warning sign for housing|Some cracks may finally be starting to show in the foundations of what has been a very strong housing market. Home Depot reported quarterly sales that missed forecasts Tuesday and the CEO specifically cited "a slow start to the spring selling season." Shares of Home Depot (HD) fell about 2% in early trading on the news. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which will report its first quarter earnings on May 23, slipped 1% as well. Home Depot's same-store sales, which measure how well locations open at least a year are doing, rose 4.2% in the quarter. But Wall Street was expecting a 5.4% jump. This was the first time Home Depot failed to top analysts' estimates in nearly two years. Rising mortgage rates could be a problem for the company. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond, a key benchmark for mortgage rates, is back above 3% and is at its highest level since July 2011. If mortgage rates continue to climb, that could make it more difficult for people to buy a house -- which would not be great news for Home Depot. And Wall Street is starting to worry that the housing boom could be coming to an end too. Shares of big builders Lennar (LEN), Toll Brothers (TOL), KB Home (KBH) and D.R. Horton (DHI) all dipped Tuesday and they are each down between 10% and 20% so far this year. Related: Here's what's killing Sears The weather was also a factor in Home Depot's disappointing quarter. While many retailers often trot out bad weather as an excuse for poor sales, it's a legitimate concern for a company that sells building products to people constructing homes outside. The word "weather" was mentioned 14 times during Home Depot's conference call with analysts. Home Depot cited "extreme winter weather" as something that hurt gardening supply sales. Sales in the northern part of the US and Canada were particularly weak. The sluggish sales growth is particularly surprising since Home Depot has been one of the better-performing retailers for some time now. Home Depot has outperformed the Dow and the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), by a wide margin for the past five years. Home Depot is a Dow component. The company has benefited from the fact that many prospective home sellers have been looking to make improvements on their homes in order to help boost the sale price. Strong demand for new homes has helped fuel Home Depot sales too. Related: Bed Bath & Beyond is in serious trouble Home Depot also continues to be part of a small group of so-called "Amazon-proof" retailers. Home Depot shoppers, particularly professional builders, are more likely to go to a store for plywood, lumber, concrete and other critical construction materials so they can actually see and touch them as opposed to simply buying them online from Amazon (AMZN). And when customers are buying online, many prefer to go to the store to pick up the products. Home Depot's online sales rose 20% in the quarter. So Home Depot's biggest challenge going forward isn't likely to be Amazon. It's rising mortgage rates.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180515082835-the-home-depot-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/25/real_estate/home-buyers-mortgage-rates/index.html?section=money_realestate|Even rising mortgage rates won't stop homebuyers|Homebuyers are proving to have some pretty thick skin. Home prices are still rising, supply is getting leaner, mortgage rates are going up and competition is intense. Yet despite all the headwinds, buyers seem to be largely resolute. "Buyer demand is still there and strong," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. "The only thing slowing demand is the lack of things to buy." Homes sold 7% faster in March compared to a year ago, according to realtor.com, while prices were 8% higher. At the same time, housing supply was down 8%. Related: Renting vs. Buying: What can you afford? And it doesn't look like the search will be getting easier anytime soon. "Very strong home prices are due to a real lack of supply ... and prices are likely to continue to run well above inflation and income growth all over the country," said Leonard Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to 4.47% last week, the highest level since 2014. "The same $250,000 budget won't buy what it would have bought you last year," said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com. "But people are still finding ways to make that $250,000 work." Experts predict rates will climb to around 5% by the end of the year. That could be the thing that finally cools off the market and pushes some buyers onto the sidelines, according to Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com. "There is an important psychological point when you cross 5%," he said. But buyers aren't giving up yet. Related: Looking to buy your first home? Good luck with that Chris Gaudreau and his fiancé, moved up their plans to buy a home as they watched prices and interest rates move higher. "We figured we had to pull the trigger before we get priced out of the market," Gaudreau, 39, said. They were looking in the Denver area and set a budget of $400,000, but were really hoping to stay around the $380,000 mark. They started their house hunt in February, and the search was intense. Their mornings started with reviewing new inventory that hit the market overnight. On good days, there would be 20 new listings. But on other mornings there were no new homes available. "That was frustrating," he recalled. He estimated that they looked at more than 70 homes over five weeks. Once they saw nine in a single day. Their list of "must haves" evolved over their search as they came face-to-face with the reality of what was available. "It was insane and so much pressure. And if you liked something, you couldn't go home and sleep on it — you had to put an offer in right away," he said. Related: Home sellers are making huge profits. So why aren't more selling? The lack of homes on the market is constraining sales as sellers are hesitant to list. Supply at the starter home level is particularly weak in markets across the country. "Entry-level buyers are going to have the biggest challenge because that is where inventory declines have continued to decline the most, and that is where the market is most competitive," said Hale. Selling the home will likely be easy, but finding a place to move into is another story. Plus, many current homeowners have likely refinanced to lock in rock-bottom rates, and taking out a new mortgage could mean higher borrowing terms. Home buyers need to act fast when they find a home. Last year, almost a quarter of all homes sold for more than the asking price, according to a recent report from Zillow. That's one reason experts recommend knowing exactly how much you can afford and are comfortable spending on a home. It's also a good idea to get pre-approved for a loan to make your offer stronger and be ready to move right away. Gaudreau and his fiancé ended up bidding on eight houses. Their winning offer was for a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half home in Aurora. The home was listed at $360,000 and they offered $370,000. They are set to close this week.

Real estate prices posted an annual gain of 6.3% in February, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices.

"It's getting increasingly difficult to be a buyer," said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com. Home buyers in Seattle, Las Vegas and San Francisco are facing the biggest gains. Seattle prices rose the most with a 12.7% year-over-year price increase, while Las Vegas prices jumped 11.6%. But so far exploding price increases haven't stopped home buyers. Homes are still flying off the shelves. For instance, the typical property in Seattle spent 29 days on the market in February, according to Realtor.com. In Vegas, time spent on the market was 42 days, and homes in San Francisco sell in just 21 days. Related: Looking to buy your first home? Good luck with that With a flourishing labor market, steady economic growth and wages finally starting to rise, home prices aren't expected to slow down anytime soon. Low housing supply has been pushing up prices as demand surges. Competition is stiff, with above-asking price offers and bidding wars being common occurrences in the country's hottest markets. Mortgage rates have also started to creep up, which adds even more pressure to the affordability problem that many homeowners face. "There is no let-up to rising home prices," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Associate of Realtors, in a statement Tuesday morning.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/22/news/economy/hurricane-foreclosures-houston/index.html?section=money_realestate|How these hurricane-ravaged states have avoided a housing disaster -- so far|After Hurricane Harvey soaked Houston with 51 inches of rain last August, Amir Befroui, a foreclosure defense specialist at Lone Star Legal Aid, started planning for a very busy spring. That's when the 90- and 180-day break on payments that mortgage companies typically give homeowners who have been hit by unexpected events like natural disasters would start to run out. But so far, few hurricane-related foreclosure cases have been coming across his desk. "We are starting to see a trickle," Befroui says. "I suspect it's going to be a gradual increase. I don't think it's going to be a tidal wave like the one that happened after Ike." According to real estate analytics firm Attom Data Solutions, foreclosure starts in hurricane-affected areas of Texas and Florida rose in the first quarter of 2018, but still remained below pre-hurricane levels. In Houston, for example, foreclosure starts had been slightly elevated due to the oil price crash of 2015 and 2016. Not counting a dip at the end of 2017, the first quarter was as low as it's been in more than 12 years, with 1,184 foreclosure starts. That's a big difference from Hurricane Ike in late 2008, where the storm exacerbated a mounting economic crisis that spurred 7,280 foreclosure starts in just one quarter. Related: Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow Even more encouraging, the number of people seriously delinquent on their loans in hurricane-affected areas of Texas and Florida continued to sink after spiking over the winter. Thousands of people were able to bring their mortgages current again after taking advantage of post-storm forbearances from their lenders. Given how damaging foreclosures can be for property values, credit scores and community stability, it appears the Gulf Coast has managed to dodge a potential hurricane housing disaster. At least, so far. Part of that is due to coordinated efforts by industry groups and consumer advocates who helped create better options for homeowners to modify their loans after the break on mortgage payments ends. But more importantly, reforms to mortgage policies following the financial crisis had already fostered a healthier housing market to begin with. Homeowners went into last year's disasters in a better place financially than they were during Hurricanes Ike, which hit in 2008, Sandy in 2012, and even Katrina in 2005. The irresponsible lending practices of the late 1990s and 2000s had largely been ended by the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which raised standards for mortgage underwriting and implemented protections for borrowers facing foreclosure. "People who've gotten mortgages post-CFPB, they don't have loans for the most part that economically they could never have afforded," says Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. Related: Disaster costs jumped over 60% this year to $306 billion Across the United States, the number of properties in active foreclosure fell in March to the lowest level since late 2006, according to the real estate data firm Black Knight. But in the case of natural disasters, programs aimed at helping distressed homeowners aren't always helpful enough. Mortgage modification programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Housing Administration — which now back about 70% of the U.S. housing market — require lots of documentation that's hard to pull together if your home is literally underwater. Homeowners were snarled in endless paperwork after Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, with each government housing agency requiring different policies and homeowners owing balloon payments that came due immediately once the forbearance period ended. So as the 2017 hurricane season got started in earnest, D.C.'s housing finance wonks came to government agencies with one fundamental ask: Design a uniform option that can give homeowners a break on their mortgages without getting them in trouble when the bills come due. "We were unsuccessful during Sandy," says Meg Burns, a former Department of Housing and Urban Development official who now heads housing policy at the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents lenders and servicers. "That's what informed our thinking to get all of the government entities around the table to make some consistent policy." Along with automatic forbearances for homeowners in hurricane-affected areas, Fannie, Freddie and the FHA came up with an option that allows borrowers to make the payments they skipped during the months after the disaster at the very end of the loan — without going through a modification that could force them to take on a higher interest rate. Related: Hurricane-struck businesses face rebuilding again "It's a different world now," says Sara Singhas, associate regulatory counsel at the Mortgage Bankers Association, referring to the recent departure from rock-bottom interest rates. "Especially for people who are performing on their loans, we wanted to make sure we don't put them into a worse financial position than they were prior to the disaster." These provisions, however, are only temporary and will sunset if they aren't renewed. "I would feel a lot better if they codified what we did," says Peter Muriungi, head of mortgage servicing for Chase Bank, which had 450,000 customers affected by the 2017 storms. On the ground, housing counselors say that lenders have been more willing to work with people who can prove they have been a victim of a hurricane. That kind of patience is not typically afforded to people facing foreclosure for economic reasons, such as spiking property taxes, which have become more of a problem in the Houston area in recent years. "The large national servicers, once they get it into their head that this is a Harvey case, then it gets moved over to the disaster recovery center rather than the traditional foreclosure side," says Sherrie Young, executive director of the Credit Coalition in Houston. But not everybody takes action in time to receive that kind of assistance, and not everybody qualifies when they do. For those who lost jobs as a consequence of the hurricanes or were already behind on their payments before disaster struck, options start to narrow. That's why thousands of people are still facing the prospect of losing their homes, and many more could run into that situation as banks lose patience in the coming months. Aid groups worry about the people who haven't yet asked for help. "I think the biggest problem lies with the folks who don't reach out," says Glenda Kizzee, a housing counselor at the Houston Area Urban League. "They're going to utilize whatever resources they have to rebuild the home, and sometimes miss the payment on the home, which is just going to make it worse. By that time, our resources are limited in what we can do." The biggest headaches, counselors say, arise with smaller servicers that have fewer resources to work with homeowners in trouble. Take Maurine Howard, whose stately home near Addicks and Barker reservoirs in Houston was inundated when the Army Corps of Engineers released the floodgates in order to avoid a breach. She paid off the three months of mortgage payments after her forbearance ended, but the mortgage company still bumped up her monthly payment from about $1,350 to $1,700. Months of phone calls, she says, still haven't managed to fix the problem, while she racks up credit card debt to make fixes on the house. "Through the process of Harvey, dealing with the mortgage company has been a nightmare," Howard says, amid stacks of paper laid out on a bed in one of the few undamaged rooms of the house. "It's never ending. You take two steps forward and five steps back."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180420180704-harvey-flooding-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/real_estate/afford-your-first-home/index.html?section=money_realestate|5 ways to afford your first home|Buying a home is a major financial undertaking, so much so that a growing number of Americans are struggling to meet that milestone. For one thing, the homeownership rate among Millennials has dropped in recent years, due in part to a limited inventory of starter homes, and also to student debt payments monopolizing so much of younger workers' income. Gen Xers are having a hard time buying homes as well. Between credit card debt and child care expenses, many workers in their 30s and 40s don't have the funds on hand to take that leap. The problem, of course, is that those who put off homeownership lose out on key tax breaks for as long as they continue to rent. If you're looking to become a homeowner, but you're finding it difficult to meet that goal, here are a few tips to make the prospect of buying more affordable. 1. Rework your budget You might think you don't have much leeway when it comes to saving money each month, but if you're willing to take a long, hard look at your budget, you'll probably come to find that there are some expenses you can manage to cut, whether it's the cable plan you can afford to downgrade or those daily lunches you know you can prepare yourself. Reworking your budget is apt to get you closer to your goal of buying a home, so comb through your expenses line by line and figure out which are less important to you. Then, pledge to reduce or eliminate those spending categories and bank the difference. 2. Get a side hustle Many people think of side hustles as a way to drum up a little extra spending money. But if you're willing to put in the time, that second gig could help you save some serious cash. Among the estimated 44 million U.S. adults who currently have a side hustle, 36% earn over $500 a month from that extra work. And that could help you reach your homeownership goal way faster than by just cutting corners here and there. 3. Consider the suburbs It's often the case that you'll get more for your money in the suburbs than in a city. If you're struggling to come up with a down payment that'll buy you more than a shoebox in your local metro area, consider expanding your search perimeter to its surrounding towns. Many suburbs offer convenient public transportation options that allow you to commute to work while enjoying the benefits of cheaper housing and bigger living spaces than what you'd find in a city. 4. Boost your credit score Though having a strong credit score won't help you come up with a down payment, it will help you qualify for the best possible mortgage rate available, thus making the prospect of homeownership more affordable on the whole. Therefore, if your score isn't stellar, it pays to take steps to raise it as quickly as possible. You can accomplish this in a number of ways. First, make a point to pay all of your bills on time. Secondly, aim to pay down a chunk of whatever outstanding balances you're carrying. This will alter your credit utilization ratio, which is a major component of determining your score. Finally, review your credit report thoroughly for errors. One in five credit reports contains a mistake; correcting yours could send your score into more favorable territory. 5. Tap your IRA Though this should only be used as a last resort, if you're really having a hard time saving for a home but are tired of throwing out money on rent, you have the option to remove up to $10,000 from an existing IRA in order to purchase your first home. Normally, withdrawing funds prior to age 59 and 1/2 would subject you to a 10% penalty, but the IRS allows this exception for first-time homebuyers. But again, this option is far from ideal, because any time you remove money from an IRA, that's less income you'll have available in retirement. Furthermore, it's not just that principal amount you're losing out on during your golden years, but the growth it could've achieved over time. Still, if you're desperate, you might choose to take an early withdrawal and make that homeownership dream come true. As a compromise, you might decide that whatever tax savings you glean from owning will go directly into your retirement plan to compensate for the sum you withdrew.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/12/news/economy/london-house-prices-coma/index.html?section=money_realestate|Property market is in a coma|London's housing market has ground to a halt. After years of blockbuster growth, home prices have reversed course and are expected to drop further over the next year. The number of sales has dropped, and more homeowners are pulling properties off the market. The dour outlook comes courtesy of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), which warned in a report on Thursday that weakness in London had caused its UK house price indicator to hit a five-year low. A number of factors have hobbled London's market. The government has in recent years hiked taxes on property purchases, making it more expensive to buy luxury housing, second homes and investment properties. Doing so has scared off some wealthy investors and caused prices to slump in central London. Britain's decision to leave the European Union has also hurt the market, with potential buyers putting their plans on hold because of the economic uncertainty. One property professional surveyed by RICS said that Brexit and the tax changes had "killed the liquidity of the London market." Related: Renting vs. Buying: What can you afford? The Bank of England is also expected to keep slowly raising interest rates as the economy grinds forward, making mortgages even less affordable for Londoners. The average house price in London is £486,000 ($690,000), according to the UK Land Registry. That's too high for many first-time buyers, whose finances have been hit by high inflation and small salary rises. But sellers would rather pull properties off the market than accept lower bids. "Buyers and sellers are currently locked in a stand-off," said Hansen Lu of Capital Economics. RICS' chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said that the slowdown in London "has the potential to impact the wider economy, contributing to a softer trend in household spending." He said the dynamic could ultimately impact the Bank of England's thinking about future interest rate rises. Still, analysts don't expect house prices to collapse in London. Inflation has moderated in recent months, employment remains strong and the British economy is growing. Lu said this should be considered "good news" for the stagnant market.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170929072004-01-london-homes-property-real-estate-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/09/technology/porsche-innodrive/index.html?section=money_luxury|Porsche offers computerized cruise control for twisty roads|I was going almost 50 miles an hour on a mountain road just north of New York City. Ahead of me, the road curved sharply to the left with just a thin metal railing between the speeding car and a long drop down a mountainside into the Hudson River. I didn't touch the brake pedal. Instead, the $120,000 Porsche Panamera plug-in hybrid I was driving slowed on its own, allowing me to steer around the curve. As I unwound the steering wheel, the car accelerated back up to speed on its own This particular Panamera had two separate cruise control systems. (The price includes both optional systems.) There was the familiar "Active Cruise Control," which uses radar to sense and slow down for traffic. These days, that's an option even on many non-luxury cars. The other, called InnoDrive, is intended for use on twisting, rural roads. You know, the sort of roads where you'd most want to drive a Porsche. Besides radar that lets it detect cars ahead and slow down, it also relies on detailed map data to know when curves or hills are coming up. The car won't steer around the curve -- that's still up to the driver -- but it will automatically slow down, even applying the brakes, to a safe speed for the curve, accelerating back up to speed on the way out. I turned the system on as I approached a road that snaked over a mountain. I could set the system to obey the posted speed limit -- it has cameras to read speed limit signs or, failing that, it can rely on its own map data. If I wanted, I could set my preferred speed higher or lower. I wanted to go faster. I took a self-driving Cadillac from New York to Washington The Panamera charged up the mountain. As I approached the first couple of curves, the Panamera didn't change speed at all. It just went right through. That didn't mean the car was unaware of the curves. It just meant that, even at the higher speed I'd set, those bends were no big deal. There was no need for the Panamera to slow down. Then came that sharp left-hander with nothing but a railing and a partly cloudy sky straight ahead. A blue arrow, curving to the left, appeared in the gauge cluster. It was the car's way of saying "Yeah, I know." The brake pedal moved down and the car's 8-speed transmission downshifted. I had set the car to Sport mode so the Panamera was moving pretty quickly. I had been warned it might be scary, but it wasn't. I had used the InnoDrive system a bit already and I'd learned to trust it. Like a lot of luxury cars, the Panamera has several driving modes including Hybrid, Sport and Sport Plus, that alter how quickly it responds to the gas pedal and steering wheel, when it shifts and gears and how firm the suspension is. The InnoDrive system plays along and drives differently, too. The self-driving car startup the car industry trusts When set to Hybrid mode, this car's default, the Panamera plug-in slowed way down and moved languidly through each turn. Even in the Sport mode, though, it never felt crazy or unsafe. Honestly, I probably would have driven through those turns faster myself. A question naturally comes to mind, though. Doesn't someone buy a Porsche so they can do all this themselves? True. But sometimes you might just want to get someplace and while you give your foot a rest. As for me, when I was done reviewing InnoDrive, I shut it off, turned the car around, and drove the same road myself using my own right foot. It was way more fun.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180503134030-prosche-panamera-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/09/pf/where-queens-money-comes-from-uk-royal-wedding/index.html?section=money_luxury|Where does the Queen's money come from?|Most people make money from their day jobs. British royals are not most people. Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family have multiple sources of income, but they're still not as rich as you might expect. Media reports have estimated the Queen's personal fortune is worth up to £360 million ($470 million). That's a nice chunk of change, but over 320 Brits are richer, according to the Sunday Times. The Queen and the heir to her throne, Prince Charles, receive most of their income from the government and their private estates. Millions trickle down to the rest of the family, including Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. Prince Harry, who will wed American actress Meghan Markle on May 19, also receives royal funds. Here's how the royal finances work: Queen Elizabeth II The Queen's three main sources of income are the Sovereign Grant, the Duchy of Lancaster estate and her personal property and investments. The Sovereign Grant -- an annual lump sum from the government -- is essentially an expense account, covering the costs of travel, security, staff and the upkeep of royal palaces. The Queen received £42.8 million ($58 million) free of tax from the Sovereign Grant in the 2016-2017 fiscal year. The payment was projected to balloon by 78% to £76.1 million ($103 million) in the latest fiscal year to help finance an extensive renovation of Buckingham Palace. The Sovereign Grant is generated from the Crown Estate, a collection of UK properties and farms that generate hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The vast majority of earnings from the Crown Estate go into government coffers, but a portion of the profits -- between 15% to 25% -- are given to the Queen in the form of the Sovereign Grant. Related: How much does a royal wedding cost? Another important source of income for the monarch is the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate of commercial, agricultural and residential properties that dates back to 1265. It produced £19.2 million ($26 million) in income for the Queen during the most recent fiscal year. The Queen uses this money to pay for official and private expenses, including some costs incurred by other members of the royal family who undertake official engagements on her behalf. Related: Everything you need to know about the royal wedding The Queen also has her own personal assets, including Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and the Sandringham Estate in the east of England. Both were inherited from her father and are beloved family retreats. But her wealth extends far beyond real estate. The Queen also owns a valuable stamp collection, numerous works of art and a stock portfolio. Other assets closely associated with the Queen, including the Crown Jewels and many works of fine art, are actually owned by the Royal Collection Trust, a charity. The Queen' husband -- Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh -- also receives an annual payment worth £359,000 ($488,000) to finance his official duties. He retired last year after more than six decades of public service. Related: Kate and William can afford 3 kids. Many Brits cannot Prince Charles and his clan Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, known formally as The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, rely on a a mix of public and private money. Over 90% of their income comes from a private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, which was established in 1337 to provide an income to the heir to the throne. The Duchy of Cornwall owns and operates land in rural and urban areas, a collection of islands and rental cottages in places like Wales and Cornwall. In the most recent financial year, the couple made £20.7 million ($28 million) from the estate. The couple also received £1.3 million ($1.8 million) from the Queen's Sovereign Grant and another £461,000 ($627,000) from various UK government departments. The Sovereign Grant is used to pay the couple's official travel and property expenses. The government cash goes toward some official overseas trips and the salaries of members of the military who protect the family. Roughly half of their annual income is spent on official duties and travel, while a quarter goes to the tax man. The remaining £6.6 million ($8.9 million) goes to Charles' children, "non-official" purchases and a royal savings account. When Markle officially joins the clan, Prince Charles has the discretion to give the couple more money. Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry are also reimbursed for costs when they perform official duties on behalf of the Queen. Prince William and Prince Harry have private, inherited wealth from their mother, Princess Diana. The rest of the family There is limited public information about how the rest of the royal family make their money. The Queen has three other children aside from Prince Charles, and they too have children, spouses and grandchildren. The Queen's two youngest children, Andrew, the Duke of York, and Edward, the Earl of Wessex, work full-time to support the monarchy, which involves appearing at public engagements on behalf of their mother. The Queen pays her children for these duties through her income from the Sovereign Grant and Duchy of Lancaster. The next generation of royals is expected to forge their own careers and required to be more independent. For example, Andrew's daughters -- Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie -- have full time jobs in the business and art worlds, respectively. But they also receive some financial support from their father.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180425175644-royal-family-money-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/23/luxury/mclaren-720s-review/index.html?section=money_luxury|McLaren 720S: It doesn't get any more sports car than this|When I drive a McLaren, I remember how I imagined the experience of driving a sports car when I was a child, long before I'd ever driven any car. I couldn't know it at the time, but the car I imagined hadn't been created yet. I imagined the engine being loud but not terrifying; that turning the steering wheel would provide the sort of immediate response I got when turning the handlebars of my bicycle. At the same time, it would not be raw or harsh. I imagined it to be like a highly civilized go-kart. The McLaren 720S is that idea perfected. It's fast, precisely loud enough, precisely refined enough and it's all wrapped in a space alien body that looks like no other car on Earth. Press the gas, and the car's turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 engine, capable of producing 710 horsepower, slams your head into back of seat. Sixty miles an hour can be reached in less than three seconds. Mash on the brake pedal and the wing in the back flips up to catch the air like a parachute while also grinding the back wheels into the pavement for greater stopping power. The ride is firm -- your rear-end is, after all, roughly dachshund-height off the ground -- but not punishingly so. The transmission shifts are quick and smart but never jarring. (Like most supercars, McLarens have automatic transmissions with paddle shifters.) Steering responsiveness, suspension stiffness and engine behavior can all be set using knobs. That's not a terribly novel idea but the ease with which it can be done using readily accessible knobs is. Press a button and the knobs are active, press it again and all the settings return instantly to the default mode. Exotic supercars of 2017 The niftiest feature is the gauge cluster. It's a computer screen or, rather, two of them. In normal driving mode, you see a big screen with all the driving information you could possibly need and a lot you probably don't. Put it in Sport mode and, to minimize distractions, the screen flips down revealing a much narrower display along what had been its top edge. That narrow screen shows you just what you really need. The car's speed down the road, the engine's running speed and what gear the seven-speed transmission is in. The experience is very similar in the less expensive McLaren 570S. By less expensive, I mean $190,000 versus $290,000. Less expensive does not mean inexpensive. That $100,000 saved means considerably less horsepower, albeit still a bunch by any normal standards. And the 570S is still very quick with a zero-to-sixty time, as measured by Car & Driver, of an even three seconds. And it still offers that unique McLaren experience which is to say, it's about as sports car as any sports car has ever been.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180423094921-mclaren-720s-2-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/13/news/royal-wedding-uk-travel-tourism/index.html?section=money_luxury|UK tourism won't get a boost|The royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is not expected to translate into an immediate boost for British tourism. Industry experts say the nuptials will act as a powerful marketing tool to entice tourists in the years to come. But there won't be more visitors during the wedding month of May. "Don't expect visitors from abroad to come for this royal wedding; it is a pageant for domestic consumption," said Tom Jenkins, CEO of European tourism association ETOA. The 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton did not result in a noticeable uptick in tourist arrivals or spending, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. This wedding shouldn't be any different. "There was no discernible increase in bookings for the UK as a consequence of the royal wedding," said Olivier Jager, CEO of the ForwardKeys, a travel research firm that monitors 17 million flight bookings a day. Analysts expect that any spike in visits from royal fanatics will be counteracted by the desire of other tourists to stay far away from the hubbub. Related: Royal wedding coverage from CNN Still, the wedding could boost visitor numbers over the long run. Deirdre Wells, head of the British travel association UKinbound, said coverage of the wedding is "the best free advertising we can wish for as a country and reminds people that they should come to the UK." Wells predicts visitors will feel compelled to book UK trips in the coming years after watching the wedding on TV. "Meghan and Harry's wedding will continue to keep the UK in focus, especially from a US perspective, which is likely to sustain the current [tourism] momentum," said Alexander Göransson, an analyst at the market research firm Euromonitor. Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite public to wedding day Visitor arrivals to the UK have been rising for years, with the country welcoming nearly 38 million people in 2017, according to Euromonitor. It's the sixth most visited country in the world. Tourism is worth £127 billion ($176 billion) annually to the UK economy, according to UKinbound. Related: How much does a royal wedding cost? The wedding will be held in Windsor, which is about 25 miles outside central London. It could be tricky to get a hotel booking near the wedding venue. But travel agents said that getting a room anywhere else, especially in London, shouldn't be a problem. "It's not going to have a huge impact on London [hotel] capacity," said Wells. US travel agents said they've had to reassure clients who previously booked travel in May that overcrowding won't be a problem. "[Clients have] asked me if I felt they should postpone and reschedule after the festivities as it might be 'too busy' in London. I emphatically told them no," said Diane Bean, a travel agent based in Maine who runs the company Off On Vacation. "I've found that prices are still stable for Great Britain as a whole," she added. Nancy Strong, CEO of Strong Travel Services in Texas, said she's considering traveling to Windsor with her granddaughter for the wedding day. But she said that clients aren't "clamoring" to visit. "Am I going to go? Yes, I probably will," she said. "When the English put on a party, they know how to do it and do it well."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171128150825-royal-wedding-1-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/06/luxury/bugatti-chiron-sport-geneva/index.html?section=money_luxury|Bugatti unveils even faster Chiron Sport at Geneva Motor Show|One of the most amazing things about the Bugatti Chiron, besides its $3 million price and top speed of 261 miles per hour, is how nicely it drives on streets where it can't go nearly as fast. But Bugatti just unveiled a new version at the Geneva Motor Show that's engineered to do even better on the track. The Bugatti Chiron Sport has just as much power as the standard car -- 1,500 horsepower via a 16-cylinder engine and four turbochargers. But, with tighter suspension and 40 pounds less weight, Bugatti says it's significantly quicker in lapping a race track. "The Chiron Sport has become perceptibly more nimble and its new agility, especially in tight corners, makes for a much more emotional experience for the driver on winding roads and handling circuits," Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said in a statement. Bugatti promises that the Chiron's gentle on-road character remains largely intact even with the improved cornering ability. The steering has been slightly modified in this version. The all-wheel-drive Bugatti Sport also has a new torque vectoring program that varies the amount of power sent to each wheel for better turning. In a tight corner, for instance, it might send more power to wheels on the outside of the curve to help push the car through the turn. The Sport model shaves down its weight by using even more carbon fiber -- the Chiron already uses an enormous amount of the lightweight, but very expensive, material. Even the Sport's windshield wiper arms are made from carbon fiber. The wipers have also been redesigned to do away with the need for an articulated joint, saving weight and making them more aerodynamic. The starting price is roughly $3.4 million for the Chiron Sport, or $400,000 more than the base Bugatti Chiron. Bugatti is part of the Volkswagen Group (VLKAY).|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180305035412-bugatti-chiron-sport-front-corner-780x439.jpg

It will be called the Cullinan. But Rolls-Royce would prefer that you don't call it an SUV. Rolls-Royce refers to it, simply, as a high-sided car. The Cullinan is named after the largest flawless diamond ever found. Weighing nearly 1.5 pounds, the Cullinan diamond was uncovered in South Africa in 1905 and, today, is owned by Queen Elizabeth. The Culllinan name is not entirely new for this vehicle, The Rolls-Royce SUV -- because, really, that's what it is -- has been called "Project Cullinan" since shortly after its development was announced three years ago. "It is the most fitting name for our extraordinary new product," Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös said in an announcement. "Cullinan is a motor car of such clarity of purpose, such flawless quality and preciousness, and such presence that it recalibrates the scale and possibility of true luxury." Rolls-Royce has been testing the Cullinan in various locations around the world, the automaker said, including African deserts, North American canyons and arctic snows. The Cullinan is just one of many ultra-luxury SUVs that are either in development or already on the market. Bentley currently offers the Bentayga, while Lamborghini recently began production of the Urus, which it bill as the first "super SUV." Lamborghini expects sell at least as many Uruses as it now sells of its sports car models combined. SUVs, which now come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and types, are the fastest growing segment of the automotive market. In the United States, SUV sales surpassed traditional car sales years ago. The Cullinan will share much of its engineering with the new Rolls-Royce Phantom full-size sedan. That vehicle was designed with a new "engineering architecture" created specifically for Rolls-Royce vehicles, distinct from other products made by parent company BMW. In the future, other new Rolls-Royces will also share that basic engineering design. Rolls-Royce also released photos of the vehicle, covered in an elaborate black-and-white color scheme to somewhat obscure details of its design. It will be shown to the public, without camouflage, some time this year.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180213080011-rolls-royce-cullinan-off-road-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/07/news/olympics-winter-pyeongchang-south-korea-travel/index.html?section=money_luxury|Here's why Americans aren't going to Pyeongchang|The Winter Olympics start this week in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But don't expect to see hordes of Americans in the bleachers. High travel costs and a shortage of hotel rooms have put Americans off attending the marquee event. Tensions with North Korea haven't helped, either. "Our travel sales to this Olympics have been very light," said Anbritt Stengele, founder of specialist travel company Sports Traveler. Pyeongchang -- with a population around 44,000 -- is not a model tourist destination. It's a two-hour train journey from the South Korean capital, Seoul. Stengele had hoped that clients would be able to stay in Seoul and commute to the Olympics. But then she factored in the time required for trains, event lines and security. "We decided not to recommend this option to our guests," she said. Flights bookings from the United States to South Korea in February were up 24% compared to the previous year, according to data from travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys. But that's a small bump for such a big event. "You would expect triple-digit growth," said David Tarsh, a spokesman for ForwardKeys. So who is going? Residents of China and Japan have run the most searches for flights to South Korea, according to data from the travel app Hopper. Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were the cities with the highest search volume for Olympic travel. Only two U.S. cities made the top 10: Los Angeles (6th) and New York (9th). The average price for round-trip flights from these cities was $800 to $930. Related: Team USA's Olympic uniforms are wearable heaters Weak demand may not be limited to the U.S. Global flight bookings to South Korea in February were up about 15% compared to last year, according to ForwardKeys. But that's not as much as you'd expect for a major sporting event. A long-running feud between China and South Korea over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system has hurt Chinese tourism in South Korea. "The real origin market that matters for [South] Korea is China," said Tarsh. "The market from China has completely collapsed." The countries with the biggest surge in interest include Vietnam, the Philippines and Canada. Bookings from Vietnam have surged more than 550% over the previous year, according to ForwardKeys. A South Korean visa waiver program contributed to this boost, said Tarsh. The number of bookings from the Philippines have more than doubled and Canadian bookings are up over 40%.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180205133610-olympic-travel-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/23/luxury/lamborghini-suv-expansion/index.html?section=money_luxury|We're not stopping with an SUV|Lamborghini is trying out a new slogan. "We are not supercars. We are Lamborghini" Wait. What? That statement, on the cover of the company's new sales brochure, sounds contradictory. If any company is supercars, it would have to be Lamborghini, right? The Italian ultra-luxury automaker pretty much invented the modern supercar, with famous cars like the Lamborghini Miura and Countach in the 1960s and '70s. But now they are Super SUVs, too. Right below that crazy statement on the brochure is a picture of the Lamborghini Urus SUV, a high-riding, four-door vehicle that just went into production on a brand new assembly line at Lamborghini's Italian headquarters. Lamborghini is billing it as something entirely new, the world's first "Super SUV." (The Urus is actually Lamborghini's second SUV model. There was only a limited run of its first, the LM002, in the late 1980s.) And the Lamborghini brand may have some more room to grow, said CEO Stefano Domenicali. An SUV is a big stretch for a brand with Lamborghini's image, but he said there could be other unexpected products in Lamborghini's future. Asked if Lamborghini is content to stop with just the SUV, Domenicali hinted that there's more to come in years ahead, but wouldn't share any specifics. Lamborghini is following the path pioneered by its sister brand Porsche. (Both are part of Germany's Volkswagen Group (VLKAF).) Porsche successfully introduced an SUV in 2002, something that many purists decried as a sort of sacrilege. In the long run, Porsche's image as a maker of top-flight sports cars suffered no lasting damage, while its balance sheet benefited enormously. Porsche has pointed out that profits from the Cayenne SUV have allowed Porsche to spend more on the development of its sports cars. Like the Porsche Cayenne, the Lamborghini Urus, according to early reviews, has the performance capabilities to credibly carry the Lamborghini logo. Lamborghini expects the new model to double the brand's sales. In Lamborghini's case, that means it will sell a total of over 7,000 vehicles a year. It also means bringing in many new customers who would never have considered owning a Lamborghini before. Porsche followed the Cayenne with the Panamera four-door car and, later, the smaller Macan SUV. A four-door Lamborghini car has been considered in the past, such when the company unveiled the Estoque in 2008. That idea never went anywhere at the time but, perhaps, it could find its place in the future. New body styles won't be the only change. There will be new power sources to drive the company's famous sports cars. Late last year, Lamborghini showed off an electric sports car concept it created with the help of MIT scientists.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180122170119-lamborghini-urus-clean-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/16/luxury/mercedes-g-class-debut/index.html?section=money_luxury|Mercedes finally changes 40-year-old SUV|The antique look of the Mercedes-Benz G-class SUV is a big part of its rugged charm. So much so, in fact, that even though the 2019 version is completely new, Mercedes designers have made sure it still looks old. Most passenger cars are completely redesigned roughly every five years to keep up with changing tastes. But is the first time the G-class has been fully redesigned in 40 years. There have been improvements over the decades -- but never a thorough wheels-to-roof makeover like this. To make the point, Mercedes placed a current-generation G-class encased in a massive cube of amber-colored resin outside the auto show. Not coincidentally, it looks like a dinosaur-era bug trapped in amber, a la Jurassic Park. G-class fans like the SUV's classic truck-like appearance. It is definitely not a crossover SUV, even though many of its owners in the United States may use it the same way someone might use a Honda CR-V. But the G-class not only looks and drives very differently from a CR-V, it also costs a good bit more. Prices for the current version start at about $124,000 in the U.S., its biggest market. The G stands for Geländewagen which means, literally, "terrain car" or, less literally, SUV. The all-new version was unveiled at an event inside a decayed abandoned theater in Detroit. The introduction featured towering jets of flames, a G-class climbing an impossibly steep looking hill, and an appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. (The connection is that Schwarzenegger was born near Graz, Austria, where the G-class is built. Also, he's strong.) Mercedes designers made every effort to maintain the Lego-built appearance of the G-class, including exposed door hinges, and even the resonating metallic thunk sound of its doors closing. Engineers also went to the trouble of designing the turn signal lamps that stand up on the front of the car so they retract on impact. That retains the classic look while still complying with modern pedestrian protection regulations, which require anything that sticks out on the front of a vehicle that could stab or poke a person must collapse out of the way in a crash. They did make some changes to modernize the vehicle and add a little more comfort. For instance, it's slightly larger all around. Despite its size, though, rear seat legroom remains a little snug by SUV standards. But there's still enough headroom to comfortably go off-roading in a top hat. The modern LED headlights, while still round, are noticeably more complex. The differences on the inside are much more noticeable. For instance, it has a large central screen, like other Mercedes cars, and the gauge cluster behind the steering wheel has also been replaced by a computer screen. It displays classic-looking round gauges, however, so the new tech doesn't ruin the old looks.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180116111608-2019-mercdes-g-class-front-quarter-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/16/luxury/ford-gt500/index.html?section=money_luxury|Ford's most powerful street car ever: New 700 horsepower Mustang|The new Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 will have over 700 horsepower, making it be the most powerful street-legal production car the company has ever made. Ford made the announcement at the Detroit Auto Show, and screened a dimly lit teaser video that gave a glimpse of a few of the car's parts, including a large rear wing. The GT500 will exceed even the power output of the Ford GT, Ford's $450,000 exotic supercar. That car can produce 647 horsepower from a turbocharged V6 engine. Since the GT500 will have over 700 horsepower, it also has a good chance of out-powering the Dodge Challenger Hellcat muscle car, which has a 707-horsepower supercharged engine. And the GT500 will probably be hundreds of pounds lighter than the Hellcat, which will make it even faster. The first Shelby GT500 appeared in 1967. That car had half the horsepower of this one. The most recent Shelby GT500, which went out of production in 2015, produced 662 horsepower from a 5.8-liter V8 engine. Ford (F) has a complicated but fruitful relationship with Las Vegas-based Shelby American company. Shelby Mustangs were originally made by Shelby using Mustangs supplied by Ford as a starting point. Shelby still does does these sort of performance conversions. In fact, there are already Shelby Mustangs, such as the Super Snake, available with over 700 horsepower. But those Shelby-made cars aren't considered Ford production cars, so Ford's "most powerful" claim still stands. In recent years, Ford has also been making some Mustang models with the Shelby name entirely in its own factories. For instance, the last Shelby GT500 was an all-Ford product, as is the current 526-horsepower Ford Shelby GT350. The new Shelby GT500 will be made by Ford, as well. Ford offered no details on the new GT500, such as exactly what sort of engine it will have or when it will be fully revealed to the public. It will be available some time in 2019.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180116114736-mustang-gt500-badge-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/05/news/sierra-leone-peace-diamond/index.html?section=money_luxury|Huge 'peace diamond' fetches a disappointing $6.5 million|One of the world's largest diamonds has been sold for $6.5 million. The stone has been dubbed the "peace diamond" because much of the proceeds will go to help the village in Sierra Leone where it was found. In past decades, the illegal trade in "blood diamonds" was used to help fund the country's devastating civil war and other African conflicts. Rather than sell the peace diamond to smugglers, the villagers brought it to the attention of the national government, which arranged for it to be auctioned. One of the world's biggest luxury jewelers, Laurence Graff, won the bidding in New York on Monday. The final price is hardly a paltry sum, but it falls short of what the Sierra Leonean government hoped the 709-carat gem might raise. In May, the government turned down a bid of $7.8 million at an auction in Sierra Leone, saying it could get "fair market value for Sierra Leone's diamonds" elsewhere. The stone is the third largest diamond in the country's history and the 14th biggest ever discovered worldwide, according to the Rapaport Group, the jewelry organization that helped bring the stone to auction. In the past, similar sized rough diamonds have sold for almost 10 times as much, said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77Diamonds.com, an online diamond jeweler. The 813-carat "Constellation" diamond, for instance, fetched $63 million last year. Related: World's second biggest diamond sells for $53 million So why didn't the peace diamond go for a higher price? "The top end of the diamond market is not at its height," Kormind told CNNMoney by email, and the gem may not be as attractive as its sheer size suggests. "The peace diamond is known to be a very complicated stone," he said. "Larger rough diamonds don't necessarily translate into large diamonds when they are cut and polished. It's all a question of the largest cleanest stone that can be gleaned from the rough. If you can't yield a single large diamond of very high quality, and instead have to make several stones out of the large stone, that decreases the value enormously." Despite the disappointing sum it fetched, the peace diamond is being held up as an example of what can happen if people digging for precious stones sell them through official channels. Earlier this year, Sierra Leonean President Ernest Koroma said he wanted to "thank the local chief and his people for not smuggling the diamond out of the country." Related: Most diamonds in the world are cut here The diamond, which was discovered in the village of Koryardu in eastern Sierra Leone, represents "our hope for a better future as the resources of Sierra Leone fund growth, development and jobs," said Pastor Emmanuel Momoh, one of the diggers who discovered the diamond. More than half the proceeds will go to government funding, including "vital life-saving infrastructure to the diggers and their communities who currently have no clean water, electricity, medical facilities, schools and roads," Rapaport Group said. About a quarter of the money will go to the diggers who found the stone, and the remainder will be used for a government program called the Diamond Area Community Development Fund.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171205132652-peace-diamond-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/28/luxury/lincoln-nautilus/index.html?section=money_luxury|Lincoln brings names back to luxury cars|Lincoln unveiled a new crossover SUV at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's not a completely new vehicle. It's really an improved version of the Lincoln MKX. It has new engine options, a new grill and lots of new technology, including a system that helps drivers steer out of a potential crash. But the most revolutionary thing it has is a name. Instead of the being called the Lincoln MKX, it will be called the Lincoln Nautilus. That's a startling departure from every other luxury automaker out there. You can buy a Mercedes-Benz S550 or you might get a Lexus LS 460 L. You could get the Genesis G80 from Hyundai's new luxury brand or an Infiniti QX80 from Nissan's. If you want a plug-in hybrid SUV you could get a BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance. But good luck finding a luxury vehicle with a name that seems to have been created by a person rather than by a cat stepping on a keyboard. Among luxury carmakers, the rationale has always been the same. They want keep the focus on the brand name, not on the individual model name. That's why Cadillac no longer sells cars named Seville or DeVille but instead sells the CT6 and XT5. It's also why Lincoln, over a decade ago, changed the name of the Lincoln Zephyr to the MKZ and why the Lincoln Aviator was replaced by the MKX. But Lincoln has kept, or brought back, a couple of model names in its line-up because the particular names carried so much weight. The Lincoln Navigator, a full-sized SUV, has always kept its name. The name Continental, once a separate ultra-luxury car brand of its own, was brought back in 2015 to go on Lincoln's new full-size luxury sedan. Experience with these two names taught Lincoln executives a lesson, said John Emmert, Lincoln's marketing manager. People actually remembered the Lincoln name better when it was attached to Continental or Navigator than by itself. Instead of acting as a distraction, the model names brought attention and distinction to the overall brand. Also, Lincoln has been trying to set itself apart among luxury brands by trying not to seem unapproachable and haughty. The phrase Lincoln executives use is "Warm, human and personally crafted." The cars are understated in design with features that focus on relaxation rather than performance or technological dazzle. Letters and numbers, he said, don't convey the desired warmth and humanity. As for the name Nautilus, you probably thought this SUV was named after a shell. Actually, the name is ultimately derived from the ancient Greek word nautes, meaning "sailor," as in nautical or astronaut. Like Navigator and Continental, it brings to mind a great journey, Emmert said. That is what Lincoln is trying to convey with this name and with those it will give its other models. Besides a new look, with a grill that resembles those on the Continental and Navigator, the Nautilus will have two engine options, a V6 and a four-cylinder, both turbocharged. Its technology features include an "evasive steer assist" which, in the event you can't brake in time to avoid rear-ending someone, will help you guide the car around the other vehicle. The Nautilus will be available in the spring at prices expected to be close to that of the MKX, which starts at around $38,000.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171128145647-lincoln-nautilus-3-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/09/investing/burberry-stock-luxury-strategy/index.html?section=money_luxury|Burberry wants to compete with Louis Vuitton, Gucci. Investors aren't so sure|Burberry is hoping to reinvent itself as a super luxury brand. But investors aren't so sure. Shares in the British fashion label dropped by as much as 12% on Thursday after the company said it planned to shift upmarket and offer more "compelling" leather goods. Burberry, which is known for its trench coats and checked patterns, also said it would refurbish its shops and stop selling its products in "non-luxury" stores. The moves are designed to help the company compete against the likes of Louis Vuitton and Gucci, which have built their reputations on pricey leather handbags. "By re-energizing our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market," CEO Marco Gobbetti said in a statement. But there are major concerns about how much the reinvention will cost. Burberry said the strategy shift would prevent sales from growing until 2021. Luca Solca, head luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the "metamorphosis isn't necessarily straight forward" because Burberry doesn't have a reputation for high-end leather goods. Market Sectors: See latest news & which stock market segments are performing best Patient investors, however, could be rewarded if the company can elevate its brand and convince discerning shoppers to splash out on more expensive items. Louis Vuitton, for example, commands vastly higher prices for similar products. Many of the chain wallets sold by the French brand in the U.K. retail for around £1,200 ($1,575), or twice the price of a comparable Burberry product. "By selling more expensive bags, [Burberry] would be able to increase margins," said Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury goods analyst at RBC Capital Markets "Everybody is trying to do the same." Related: You'll soon be able to eat breakfast at Tiffany's first-ever cafe Burberry is also in the process of changing key personnel. In October, the company announced that designer Christopher Bailey, who is credited with reviving the brand, would be leaving after 17 years. Solca said that Gobbetti needs to quickly find a worthy successor, preferably someone with a deep knowledge of handbag designs. "Any news on the new creative director -- as well as more clarity on the transition period -- should be a key share price driver today and in the near future," Solca said. Burberry stock had been enjoying a very nice 2017, with shares rallying 35% before Thursday. The firm's biggest markets are the U.S. and China, followed by the U.K., Japan and Germany, according to market data provider, FactSet.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171109084857-burberry-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/06/news/queen-offshore-investments-paradise-papers/index.html?section=money_luxury|Queen's estate invested $13 million in offshore tax havens|Leaked documents published on Sunday suggest that the private estate of Queen Elizabeth II invested in offshore funds. Revelations from the leak, which has been dubbed the Paradise Papers, were reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and outlets including The New York Times. In Britain, the BBC said it had seen documents that show the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income, had invested £10 million ($13.1 million) into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. The documents have not been reviewed by CNN. The Queen has not been accused of any wrongdoing. But the investments are potentially embarrassing for a royal family that closely guards its reputation. "We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate," the Duchy of Lancaster said in a statement. The Duchy added that the Queen, who is officially exempt from U.K. tax laws, "voluntarily pays tax" on income she receives from the estate. The £519 million ($680 million) Duchy, which provides the Queen with an income to cover official expenses, says it invests primarily in commercial, agricultural and residential properties. In the most recent fiscal year, the Duchy generated £19.2 million ($25 million) in net income according to its website. Related: What you need to know about the Paradise Papers One of the Duchy's offshore investments has generated some controversy. The BBC reported that the Duchy invested $7.5 million in Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP in 2005. The fund, which invested in medical and tech companies, later put money into U.K. retailer BrightHouse. The Duchy said its investment in the company is worth £3,208 ($4,200). BrightHouse, which gave customers credit so they could buy its home furniture and appliances, was later forced to compensate consumers after the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority found it was not a responsible lender. "We sincerely apologize to those customers who were affected," the company said in October. "We're absolutely determined that this doesn't happen again and have made significant improvements over the last 18 months." The Duchy said in a statement that the investment in BrightHouse was made "through a third party," and equates to just 0.0006% of the Duchy's value. The ICIJ noted in its report that "there are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts," and it was not suggesting that any people or companies it named either broke the law or acted improperly. David Pitt Watson, an executive fellow at the London Business School who focuses on responsible investments, said he "very much" doubts that the Queen knew where her money was invested. Instead, she's like "so many others who have a pension, or an investment account," he said. "We just don't know what is being done with it." The Paradise Papers reporting is similar to the Panama Papers, which in 2016 exposed cases involving celebrities and business executives who reportedly moved large chunks of their wealth into offshore tax havens. The new project, which is based on more than 13.4 million documents dated from 1950 to 2016, covers a large number of global corporations and prominent people and their use of offshore accounts. -- Max Foster contributed reporting.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160420145613-queen-elizabeth-ii-780x439.jpg

The British luxury automaker, which is closely associated with the James Bond movie franchise, announced it's partnering with a property developer to build a new 66-story residential tower in Miami, Florida. The companies broke ground on the new Aston Martin Residences on Wednesday, and expect the building will be finished in 2021. A move into luxury real estate may seem unusual for an automaker that's built a global brand based on its high performance cars. But Aston Martin is trying to branch into new sectors outside its traditional niche. Just weeks ago it announced it was collaborating with Triton Submarines to build a handful of luxury submarines with a price tag around $4 million each. Last year, it unveiled a powerboat. It has even collaborated on high-end baby strollers. Aston Martin says it is being very picky about the projects it collaborates on to avoid diluting its brand. "Partnerships only happen if it's the right partner," said Marek Reichman, Aston Martin's chief creative officer. The new curved luxury building, which is shaped like a sail, will feature 391 condos, pools, a virtual golf room and two cinemas. The residences, which range from 700 to 19,000 square feet, are priced from $600,000 to upwards of $50 million. Related: China shuts down billionaire's golf courses The project is being led by property developer G&G Business Developments. G&G CEO German Coto said partnering with Aston Martin would help elevate the status and design of the building. "We realized we needed a brand that would take the whole project to a new [level]," he said. Aston Martin will design the common areas shared by residents, which will feature "grey and black carbon fiber furniture." It will also work on some exterior elements. The automaker is licensing its name for use on the building. G&G, which has already received $150 million in deposits, expects it will make about $1 billion from the condo sales. It's not the first automaker to get into Miami real estate.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/11/luxury/classic-bentley-drive/index.html?section=money_luxury|Bentley has rediscovered its racing roots|When you think of Bentley, you probably think of lounging in a big leather back seat, sipping champagne and maybe licking a spot of Grey Poupon off your pinky finger. Nope. That's Rolls-Royce. But your confusion is understandable. For about 70 years Rolls-Royce owned Bentley and, during that time, there really wasn't an awful lot of difference the two. Bentleys were Rolls-Royces but a little different. Since then, though, the two manufacturers have gone their own ways. Rolls-Royce is now owned by BMW, and is all about being the ultimate opulence machine. Meanwhile Bentley, which is now owned by Volkswagen, is returning its long-lost roots as a race car company. Comfort and luxury, yes, but with a heavy dollop of speed. In May 2015, a Bentley GT set a speed record with actor Idris Elba at the wheel. Then, in September of that same year, a Bentley Bentayga became the world's fastest production SUV, hitting 187 miles an hour on a test track. Bentley first achieved fame in the 1920s, on the race track. The Bentley Boys, a crew of British race drivers, helped make the brand famous when they racked up piles of race wins in the 1920s. Bentley's race cars were big and not particularly light, but they were fast enough to beat the likes of Bugatti on the track. Those victories translated into sales. David Gooding, head of the classic car auction company Gooding & Co., took me out for a ride in one of Bentley's top performance models of that time, a 1926 6-1/2 Liter LeMans Sport. The day after we drove it, it would sell for $700,000. It would have gone for more, Gooding said, had the body been original. But like the original, this car's body was made largely from Rexine, a sort of faux leather, stretched over a wood framework. Its massive 6-cylinder engine could produce about 180-horsepower. You can get as much power from a 4-cylinder Toyota Camry today, but that was eye-popping back then. Just sitting in the car reminded me of the courage race drivers had then. Sitting high on its tall, skinny tires, it had no stability control, anti-lock brakes or airbags, of course, but it also lacked a roll cage and seatbelts. The engine roared and the transmission gears whirred as we rounded curves along the California coastline. As we headed into a tight turn, Gooding told me this car wasn't really designed for cornering -- still, he didn't slow much. It was built for flat out speed on the straights. The ride was surprisingly Bentley-like and I could tell the power would have been immense to someone used to ordinary 1920s driving. This wasn't his own car, but Gooding has one like just it in his collection. He likes to take his Bentley 6-1/2 Litre out on the interstate, he said. It's great fun charging down the left lane at 80 or 90 miles an hour and watching drivers glance in their rearview mirrors then move aside for what is, apparently, a freight train coming up on them. Like turns, stopping is also not this car's strength, he told me. Panic stops are cause for legitimate panic. "When you lock up the brakes at 85 miles an hour, it gets, um, exciting," he said. I've driven plenty of modern Bentleys that are, quieter, faster and way better at cornering and stopping than the LeMans Sport. It was surprising, though, how straight a line could be drawn from that car to Bentley's modern Continental GT. Granted, Bentley spent over 70 years owned by Rolls-Royce. But, ultimately, the car maker came around to more or less the same place: Producing big, comfortable, fast cars.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171006151903-1926-bentley-lemans-sport-front-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/09/news/whisky-scotland-uk-alcohol/index.html?section=money_luxury|Scotland just can't make enough Scotch whisky|Two Scottish distilleries that have been closed since 1983 are being reopened to help satisfy a growing thirst for premium whiskies. Global booze giant Diageo (DEO) announced Monday that it would invest £35 million ($46 million) to bring the "lost" distilleries back from the dead by 2020. The distilleries -- Port Ellen and Brora -- are best known for their medium-peated single malt Scotch. Diageo said that the move "reflects the strong growth in the single malt Scotch market and the opportunity to create new generations of whisky consumers." The London-based company, which makes whiskies including Johnnie Walker, Talisker and Lagavulin, said the reopened Scottish distilleries will be among its smallest, each producing roughly 800,000 liters a year. Demand for single malt Scotch -- which is made from the product of a single distillery rather than a blend -- has skyrocketed in recent years. Scottish exports of single malts have increased from 47 million bottles in 2002 to 114 million in 2016, according to the Scotch Whisky Association. The value of the exports topped £1 billion ($1.3 billion) for the first time in 2016. Jeremy Cunnington, a senior alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor International, said that opening these facilities will help meet growing demand for high-end, craft concoctions. "The returns can be spectacular," he said. Related: Scotland's smallest distillery fears Brexit The industry's problem is that single malts have always been, by design, a limited commodity. Distillers produce a set amount in a given year, and essentially guess what demand will be like when the spirit matures. Scotch must be aged for a minimum of three years by law. Diageo said these new whiskies will be aged for 12 years. Andy Simpson, co-founder of brokerage service Rare Whisky 101, warned that restarting production may dilute the value of vintage Port Ellen and Brora bottles, which can sell for thousands of dollars each. "Part of the enduring allure of both Port Ellen and Brora is that they haven't produced a single drop since 1983," he said. "With the distilleries reopening, will collectors and connoisseurs be quite so enthused to get their hands on rare Port Ellen and Brora stock?

An estimated 95 pounds of gold is flushed through Swiss sewage systems each year, according to a study by the aquatic science institute Eawag. The lost gold is worth nearly $2 million at current prices. The researchers believe the tiny flecks of gold flow into the waste water system from the country's famed watchmaking industry and gold refineries. The study, commissioned by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, involved surveys of 64 waste water treatment plants across the country. Some areas had higher concentrations of gold than others. In one part of southern Switzerland that is home to several gold refineries, elevated levels of metal deposits might even be worth collecting. "Concentrations of gold in sewage sludge are sufficiently high for recovery to be potentially worthwhile," the researchers wrote. The scientists found other unexpected elements in the water: large amounts of silver and even rare earth minerals often used in the manufacture of electronic devices. The researchers estimated that over 6,500 pounds of silver ($1.8 million at current prices) flows into Swiss waste water each year. Related: Germany repatriates $31 billion in gold from Paris and New York Gold and silver aren't the only valuable items found in Swiss waste water this year. In September, Swiss investigators launched a probe into why two Spanish women flushed roughly €100,000 ($120,000) down toilets in Geneva. The Geneva Prosecutors' Office said they found cut-up €500 bills had been flushed down toilets at a UBS bank branch and three nearby restaurants.

Is it a cider or something? I hated the first sip." That was Ntsiki Biyela's first reaction after she won a scholarship to study winemaking in 1998. Now she's an international award winning vintner and resident winemaker at the Stellekaya winery in Stellenbosch -- east of Cape Town, South Africa. She's also the country's first black female winemaker in an industry dominated by white men. "I'm surrounded by men who are supportive, but in general it's a struggle because you have to do twice as much to prove yourself," she told CNNMoney. Her wine is sold globally but her main market is the United States. And she has plans to start her own brand later this year. Related: South Africa's wine industry is booming Biyela's life began in 1978 in a small village in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, where the only alcohol she encountered was home brewed beer. As a black South African, Biyela suffered discrimination and oppression under the brutal apartheid regime. Driven by an urge to create a better life for herself, she started looking for opportunities outside of her village. "I wanted to do chemical engineering but I couldn't because of the financial situation," she said. Soon after apartheid was abolished in 1994, South African Airways began offering wine making scholarships as part of a program to help transform the country's economy. Biyela jumped at the chance. "There was an opportunity to study, and become something," she told CNNMoney. So she left her village and family to pursue a career in making something she had never tasted. At Stellenbosch University, Biyela not only had everything to learn about wine but she had to study in a language synonymous with oppression, Afrikaans. "It was difficult. I didn't know Afrikaans but I had no choice,'" she said. Graduating was just the first step. Biyela still had to find work in an industry that wasn't exactly welcoming to a black South African woman. She was turned away three times before she landed a job at what she calls the "modern" Stellekaya. And she quickly found success. Her first harvest in 2004 produced an award winning wine. It was a bottle of that very vintage that Biyela took back to her home village. During the trip, her grandmother Aslina tasted wine for the very first time. Her response? "It's nice." Biyela is now preparing to launch a new wine as an independent wine maker. She'll be leaving Stellekaya and will buy grapes from farmers because she can't afford her own vineyards just yet. But she already has a name for the brand: Aslina.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160224130936-south-africa-vineyard-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/23/smallbusiness/india-trash-bin-wifi-thinkscream/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|Want to clean up India? Turn trash into free Wi-Fi|Trash belongs in the garbage bin. It's a simple civic lesson that has frustrated two Mumbai entrepreneurs for years. "India is a country where people love to break the rules," said Raj Desai, cofounder of startup ThinkScream. "We see it on the roads where no one is driving in their lane. We see it in the way people disrespect public spaces by throwing garbage anywhere that they want to." So Desai and cofounder Pratik Agarwal had an idea: Reward people for throwing things away. Related: Inside Mumbai's colorful taxis The idea for the smart garbage can came about at a popular Bangalore music festival in 2013. "Pratik and I got lost and it took us two hours to find each other," said Desai. "It struck us that we needed to come up with a solution for people to stay connected at these events." They were also struck by the massive amounts of trash everywhere. So Desai and Agarwal, both 26, invented a trash can that rewards people with 15 minutes of free Wi-Fi every time they throw something away. The plastic bin (which costs about $1,470) is four-and-a-half feet high with an LED screen. When you throw something in it, the screen flashes a unique code to access 15 minutes of Wi-Fi (which works within a 50 meter radius). ThinkScream partnered with a local telecom company and debuted six smart bins at a music festival in 2014. Since then, the startup has received a number of inquiries from companies who see it as a viral branding opportunity, Desai said. "But that wasn't our intention," he said. "It wasn't a gimmick. It was meant to be a catalyst for the public to change their behavior and stop littering." Related: Delhi to revive car restrictions in effort to clean air Using technology to change behavior is what Desai and Agarwal set out to accomplish when they launched their startup in 2012. ThinkScream comes up with innovative ways to provide Wi-Fi to Indian consumers. Its flagship product, customized for movie theaters in Mumbai, allowed people to use Wi-Fi to order food from the concession stand and and have it delivered to their seats. They rolled it out into 60 theaters in Mumbai. ThinkScream has also partnered with music festival organizers to provide attendees with easy Wi-Fi access. How successful are the bins? It's too early to tell, said Desai. "We haven't done a before-and-after analysis yet, but anecdotally we know that people do like to use the bin for the wow factor at first and then for the free WiFi," he said. ThinkScream doesn't have any smart bins currently deployed (although there are a few test bins at events and colleges). But Desai is encouraged that private companies and government agencies have reached out to see how the bins can be deployed in large cities like Mumbai. Mumbai, Desai's hometown, is India's most populous city with more than 18 million residents. It is also the world's fifth top producer of solid waste, according to a May 2015 report by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The city generates over 7,000 tonnes of solid waste daily, according to India's Central Pollution Board Control agency. And a lot of that waste isn't properly contained in trash bins. "It's unhealthy and can lead to diseases," said Desai. Related: This plastic toilet could save lives The free Wi-Fi could entice people in urban settings where more residents have access to mobile devices. But what about rural areas? Desai said he's already thought about how to tweak the bin's design. "Instead of free Wi-Fi, we'll use an interactive image of a celebrity," he said. One example: Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. "The LED screen could show a photo of Tendulkar frowning. But he'll smile if you throw trash in the bin," said Desai. Desai wants to soon have his smart trash cans around India -- everything from movie theaters and malls to public spaces and rural communities. "This is just one way to help change the mindset of people in India," said Desai. "We just hope that bureaucracy doesn't slow us down."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160219105019-wifi-trash-can-split-780x439.jpg

Ted Cruz is there. So are Bernie Sanders and Marco Rubio. Who's not there in Bleacher Creatures' newest lineup of plush dolls inspired by the 2016 presidential candidates? Donald Trump. Bleacher Creatures is best known for its 10-inch plush figures of famous athletes like New York Yankees' Derek Jeter, Cleveland Cavaliers' Lebron James and the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Last year it hit a home run with its Pope Francis doll (selling more than 50,000 of them) to commemorate the papal visit to the United States. On Saturday, Bleacher Creatures will unveil its newest dolls in the likeness of political characters at the North American Annual Toy Fair in New York City. "This is our first foray into politics," said Matt Hoffman, CEO of Plymouth, Pa.-based Bleacher Creatures, which sells more than 1 million dolls a year. Related: Pope Francis has arrived...as a plush doll Hoffman said early polls determined who got a Bleacher Creatures transformation. So why is Donald Trump missing from the group? Heck, even former presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan earned a doll. The official explanation from the company is that Trump is a celebrity and celebrity likenesses require licenses. "We worked directly with the Trump Organization and in the end we weren't able to get a deal," said Hoffman. The Trump campaign declined to comment. Hoffman said he has a Trump doll prototype ready if the candidate changes his mind.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/12/technology/recycling-carbon-dioxide-liquid-light/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|She's recycling carbon dioxide with hopes of reducing oil dependence|Carbon dioxide gets a bad rap. Out of all the waste gases produced by human activity -- manufacturing, agriculture, electricity production, transportation -- carbon dioxide is the biggest byproduct and is fingered as the leading culprit behind global warming. In fact, it accounts for 76% of all annual global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But Emily Cole doesn't focus on the negatives. The 32-year-old scientist has created technology that would recycle carbon dioxide into something extremely useful. Related: Elon. Evolution Cole is cofounder and chief science officer of Liquid Light. The startup is pioneering a process to convert carbon dioxide gas into a chemical that can be used to make consumer products. She founded the startup in 2009 and immediately got to work developing technology to capture carbon dioxide and recycle it. "Right now, waste carbon dioxide is captured and sequestered," said Cole. This means the gas is collected from facilities like industrial plants or manufacturing sites, compressed in pipelines and then injected into rock formations deep underground. "Instead of storing it, we're utilizing it and converting it into something of value," she said. Liquid Light is the first company that's developed a catalyst (a combination of water, sunlight, electricity and other chemicals) to make other chemicals out of carbon dioxide. "We take carbon dioxide from its source [like power plants or factories], add water and electricity to it, and create liquid fuels and chemicals such as ethylene glycol and glycolic acid," said Cole. Those chemicals could eventually replace petroleum in everyday consumer products like plastic bottles, carpets, antifreeze, even facial creams. The benefits are manifold: "We reduce our dependence on petroleum, which is not renewable," said Cole. "We make these products with lower carbon dioxide emissions and we can possibly lower the production costs." Related: These startups could change the world Cole has a Ph.D. in chemistry from Princeton University. But her passion goes back to her high school days in Texas. "I had a great teacher who really got me interested and excited about chemistry," she said. At Princeton, she collaborated with Professor Andrew Bocarsly, who had already been working on ways to recycle carbon dioxide. "His project was stalled for many years because there wasn't a lot of interest or funding for it," she said. But she saw potential, and worked to take his research one step further. After graduating from Princeton, Cole attracted investment from venture capitalists to start her firm and develop the technology. (While she declined to say how much Liquid Light has raised, CrunchBase reports it has received $23.5 million in several rounds of funding.) Related: 3D printers could soon make human skin Liquid Light, which now has a team of 12, hopes to pilot the technology next year and then license it for commercial use. Big companies have already taken note. Last year, Coca Cola (KO) partnered with Liquid Light to help accelerate the commercialization of the technology. The technology is especially relevant to Coca-Cola because it could help reduce the cost of producing mono-ethylene glycol, one of the components used to make the company's plant-based PET plastic bottles. She said there was another "big industry name" that would soon be announcing a partnership as well. "My dream is really that we're able to commercialize this technology and reduce our dependence on oil," she said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160210101657-emily-cole-1-780x439.jpg

Late Wednesday, Dy stood before Richard Branson for seven minutes and pitched his startup Bloom Technologies in the final round of the Extreme Tech Challenge contest. The San Francisco-based firm has developed a wearable sensor tied to an app that allows expectant moms to track their pregnancy, such as frequency, duration, and intensity of contractions. Bloom Technologies was one of three finalists that traveled to Necker Island, Branson's private Caribbean island, and pitch their business directly to the titan. Dy's presentation landed Bloom Technologies the big win. "It was a very long evening but a terrific one for us," said Dy, the company's co-founder and CEO. Dy, 36, was the last to present, but the Caribbean island setting helped to calm his nerves. "We were out in the open, at a beautiful beach house that rolled into grass tennis courts," he said. "And the beach was right behind us." Related: How this STEM school is shattering stereotypes Bloom Technologies will make its device available to consumers this summer. With that launch date just a few months away, Dy honed his pitch to tightly focus on the startup's commercialization strategy and plans to gain traction after hitting the market. It helped that Branson is a proud father and grandfather. Branson's daughter delivered twins in late 2014. Dy said his pitch prompted Branson to bring up his daughter, who he said had a pregnancy complication, and ask how Bloom's sensor would have helped her. "Most of the judges have experienced raising kids and even grandkids. So our company's mission resonated with them," said Dy. "They understood what it means to have a pregnancy go well and the heartbreak when it doesn't." The other judges were Google Maps co-inventor Lars Rasmussen and Samsung Electronics President Young Sohn Related: This plastic toilet could save lives The win for Dy doesn't result in a monetary prize. All three companies (Giroptic and Sphero were the other finalists) that made it to the end got the same prize package: mentoring from top entrepreneurs, tech and infrastructure support from IBM (IBM)and Amazon, (AMZN) and the potential to raise new funding from investors at Necker Island. However, the winner does get the bragging rights and a chance to be invited back to Necker Island to schmooze with Branson next year. Dy didn't wait for next year. He wasted no time in approaching investors right after his win. "Some of the judges and folks in the audience did express interest in investing in Bloom," he said. What about Branson?

http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/09/smallbusiness/stem3-academy-education/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|How this STEM school is shattering stereotypes|At STEM3 Academy, sticking to the norm doesn't work. In fact, the school was launched to do just the opposite. "Our emphasis is on learning versus teaching," said Dr. Ellis Crasnow, the school's director. "Our students learn by doing, experiencing and constructing rather than just sitting in a classroom listening to a teacher." STEM3 Academy largely focuses on "STEM" subjects: science, technology, engineering and math). Teachers there use a "flipped classroom" model. This means that time in class is used to complete projects and homework assignments, while time at home is spent reviewing the next day's lessons. The Los Angeles school took an out-of-the-box approach for a specific reason: All of its students have a learning challenge, like autism-spectrum disorder, Asperger's and ADHD. The students are especially gifted in subjects like math and science, but have fallen behind in their social and communication skills. (The curriculum also includes traditional subjects like English, art and language.) "As far as we know, we're the nation's only STEM-curriculum school for students with these needs," said Crasnow. "Our goal is to help them realize their potential for achievement in school, in college and later in a STEM-based career." Related: Wanted: 100,000 new STEM teachers STEM3 Academy is part of The Help Group, a nonprofit that runs 10 special-needs focused schools in the L.A. area. It opened as a high school with 30 students in August 2015. As word spread, Crasnow started getting calls from parents nationwide. Two months later, it added middle school. The school now has 60 students in grades 6-12. About 75% of the students at STEM3 are placed by a district program (which pays the tuition). Otherwise, tuition is $35,000. STEM3 Academy has an innovation lab that's equipped with a CNC machine, 3D printer, CAD machines and electronics. It also offers programs in robotics, entrepreneurship and programming. Much of the learning is based on group work to facilitate social interaction (the students sit at large communal tables). "The statistics are telling," said Crasnow. "We know that 34% of students with these learning challenges that go on to college chose STEM majors." Some large companies -- including defense contractor Raytheon (RTN) and aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman (NOC) -- have already approached the school about potentially working with the students. Related: The most innovative schools on America Terry Whiteside's son Cullen is a junior at the STEM3. He was previously in two other schools in The Help Group's network. Whiteside said Cullen, who has autism, is gifted in math and programming, but struggled socially before coming to STEM3. "It's been a big change," she said. "Before he wouldn't talk much about his day. Now he comes home and has conversations with me about what he did at school." Related: This is how you make math fun She compared this to his performance growing up -- his standardized test results were poor, even though she knew how bright he was. "What's so amazing to us as parents is how far Cullen has grown since we started the educational journey," she said, adding that he tested in the 99th percentile of the PSAT and has had interest from several top-rate colleges. Cullen symbolizes what STEM3 Academy is trying to achieve. "The stats regarding the post high school success of students with special needs is very poor. 80% to 90% of them are unemployed or underemployed," said Crasnow. "These are horrific numbers and our goal is to change them." Crasnow said STEM3 Academy will become a K-12 school by the end of the year. "We want our students to be able to stand side by side with their typical peers after they graduate," he said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160204162043-stem3-academy-780x439.jpg

That's the message of a global grassroots nonprofit called Techfugees. Techfugees held its first U.S.-based event on Tuesday. Roughly 180 tech professionals gathered in New York City at Civic Hall. Attendees -- who hailed from places like Warby Parker, Mastercard and General Assembly -- had eight hours to work on tackling four aspects of refugee education, like enrollment barriers and language hurdles. "People don't know how to take their compassion and turn it into action," said Brian Reich, director at The Hive, an innovation lab that's a part of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "Our job is to move the refugee crisis into a frame people understand -- into a product challenge." Related: How to make Americans care about refugees Techfugees was founded in September, shortly after images surfaced of a dead young Syrian child who washed ashore in Turkey. A small group of European techies wanted to help people leverage their technical skills and innovative thinking in a way that could tangibly help agencies and refugees. "Most of the people in the room wouldn't have responded to 'cry and buy' messaging," said Reich, referencing the traditional methods of appealing to emotion for donations. "This is not about philanthropy on the margins." Related: This plastic toilet could save lives The goal of this particular Techfugees event was to create a list of the major questions that tech needs to answer -- and then start thinking about how the solutions might look. Questions like: What keeps girls from attending school? Who are the teachers and what are their backgrounds? What kind of devices do students have and how reliable is their Internet access? There were hundreds of questions, and the discussions at the New York event just scratched the surface. The idea is that other groups will use it as a jumping off point and start actually coding solutions. (A group called Hacktivation plans to host a 48-hour coding retreat for Bay Area engineers to build some of this out.) Opinion: Big business must 'hack' refugee crisis Traditionally, "no one talks to each other," Reich said. "Groups are all trying to solve [the crisis], but events happen disparately." The beauty of Techfugees -- which Reich said has 25,000 in its global community -- is that it brings together people from all different disciplines: nonprofits, startups, corporations and government. "I hope that today will just be the beginning," said Samantha Power, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, who opened the event Tuesday morning. "We are facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. It is a 21st century crisis and we need a 21st century solution."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160209173037-syrian-refugees-tech-780x439.jpg

First class travel for pets? Why not? But there's one group of people whose job it is to say no to them. Meet the Hollywood business managers. They're paid to guide the stars away from money pitfalls, helping them invest the proceeds from their latest project. Occasionally, their task is to stop celebrities spending beyond their means, which can mean putting the brakes on extravagant purchases. "I tell my clients that if they only want to hear yes, I'm not the right person. I'm going to tell you no," says Michael Kaplan, a partner at Miller Kaplan Arase in Los Angeles. Kaplan was named one of The Hollywood Reporter's 25 most powerful business managers last year. "I'm going to tell you what you need to hear, not you want to hear," he says. Related: The businessman who turned $40 into $6 billion How much for an island? From collecting cash receipts to overseeing investments, business managers handle daily money matters for A-listers. They also advise when it comes to purchases -- cars, boats, houses or something more outlandish. "One of my clients wanted to buy an island," recalls Kaplan. "And yeah, it's a wonderful idea, but then you realize what you have to do for upkeep." Restaurants also raise red flags. Britney Spears' now defunct Nyla restaurant and Jennifer Lopez's Madres eatery are just two examples of many doomed forays into the hospitality business. Kaplan says his clients put cash into the restaurant trade because they can afford to lose it. "We already set aside enough money from real investments. We've already put that aside, and dealt with that, and basically said to them, 'hey, here's a chunk of money. Enjoy. Do what you want with it.'" Related: How to create a restaurant empire A roller-coaster career Kaplan says his job is to help clients live the lives they want, while planning for the uncertainty that comes with a career in entertainment. "The thing that you have to understand with celebrities is that the entertainment industry is like a roller coaster. There are ups and downs and you have to make sure that you cover that," he says. If you're not visible, you're invisible For those forging a career in the public eye, there's the added pressure of maintaining a media profile. "Unfortunately, that's the nature of the business, because if they're not visible, they're invisible," Kaplan says. This means frequenting trendy restaurants, going on exotic holidays or appearing at hotspots where their picture will be taken -- and that means splashing cash. "If they're not picked up on CNN or People magazine or US magazine or those types of things, then people start to wonder, 'are they washed up? What's happening to them?'" says Kaplan. "So that's the balance that you have to maintain.

Medical or recreational marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. As legalization has increased, so have sales. In 2013, the industry was at $1.8 billion. In 2015, it was estimated at $5.4 billion (accounting for evolving business models), according to the ArcView Group, a cannabis-focused investment and research firm. "The cannabis industry is so new that there are very few barriers to get in, especially for women," said Giadha DeCarcer, CEO and founder of New Frontier, which provides data analysis for the marijuana industry. More importantly, she said the marijuana industry isn't as heavily skewed toward men as many other industries. It's what personally appealed to DeCarcer, a former investment banker and consultant in technology and defense. "Those are all heavily male dominated areas. It was the biggest frustration for me," she said. "It made it harder to rise to the top." DeCarcer launched New Frontier in 2014. She said the business doubled in value and size in less than a year. She said it's profitable but won't disclose revenue. Related: Take a weed break at work.

Jane West is at the forefront of this trend. West, "a proud cannabis user," cofounded Women Grow, a professional networking group for women in cannabis. Its first event in 2014 had 70 attendees. Now it has chapters in 44 cities, with 21,000 subscribers to its weekly newsletter and 30,000 followers on Instagram. The Women Grow summit kicks off February 3 in Denver. West expects the three-day event to have more than 1,500 attendees this year, including singer-songwriter, Melissa Etheridge. "There is nothing but opportunity for women in this industry. We need to spread the word," said West. "Women are coming up with terrific business ideas. Many of them are driven by their advocacy for legal marijuana." Related: The women of marijuana Salwa Ibrahim has been an advocate of legal marijuana for a long time. "I'm also from the Bay Area, which is the birthplace of the medical marijuana movement," she said.

"I attracted the best possible talent and gave them incentives to stay and grow with the business," she said. Blum now sees 800 to 1,000 patients a day, and has added a cultivation center, production facility and 70 employees. More than half of her staff are women. Last month, her business was acquired by Terra Tech Corp (TRTC). Ibrahim is staying on as executive director and adding two dispensaries in Las Vegas and one in Reno.

When a manager position came open, she threw her hat in and was promoted. "I earned everyone's respect because I worked my way up," she said. She quit last November to start AOW Management, a cannabis cultivation and dispensary management company. "Business is going really very well," she said. But Gote now wants to see more women on her side of the business. "I would love to hire women," she said. "In fact, I would hire women right now with no experience. This way I can teach them from the beginning everything that I learned."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160128145528-giadha-decarcer-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/08/news/lehman-brothers-whiskey/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|Lehman Brothers is back... in a whiskey bottle|Lehman Brothers is synonymous with financial catastrophe, but one entrepreneur hopes the brand will make him a fortune -- as a range of Scotch whiskey. James Green, 34, is launching three whiskies with Lehman Brothers on the label. The most popular of the range, "Ashes of Disaster," claims to have a "wicked suggestion of burning banknotes, a hint of ripe autumn fruit about to fall." Lehman Brothers collapsed in the largest U.S. bankruptcy in history in September 2008, sparking the global financial crisis. A British real estate investor, Green filed in 2013 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to use the term "Lehman Brothers" for bars and spirits. He says he's now taking online orders for the whiskey from bar chains in London and New York. Barclays Bank (BCS), which bought parts of Lehman Brothers, filed in 2014 to stop Green using the name. It noted, among other arguments, that the investment bank often gave "cut crystal whiskey decanter[s] etched with the mark Lehman Brothers" as gifts, which means its trademark should extend beyond banking. The filings show Barclays suspended its case in October 2015. Barclays declined to comment. Green told CNNMoney an outcome of the dispute is "pending" so his lawyers have told him to sell as much whiskey as he can. "It's full speed ahead," said Green, who expects bartenders on both sides of the Atlantic to be pouring the whiskey within months. Related: Drink up? Whiskey investing brings huge returns Another of Green's Lehman whiskies is his spicy American-made "Snapfire," which he suggests is "perfect with reckless maneuvers, long gambles, and explosive consequences. Drink alone, if possible." Green is now looking for investors to help him open Lehman Brothers themed bars, including one on Wall Street. It would perhaps be the perfect place to sell the third whiskey in the range, called "Evergreen." It is being marketed as "perfect for when fortune is with you and you are riding your luck. Tastes best when you are sitting on top of the world."|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160208104741-lehman-brothers-whiskey-780x439.jpg

http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/02/smallbusiness/guns-women-concealed-carry/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|Women are reshaping the gun industry|Women are buying handguns in record numbers -- especially weapons that are small enough to conceal. But they are frustrated by the lack of firearm accessories catering to them. So some are starting companies of their own to tailor products to women. "I thought to myself, 'Where's all the women's stuff?'" said Lorelei Fay of Boise, Idaho. Fay couldn't find a suitable holster when she got her own concealed carry license. Her mother had taught her to sew, so she made her own: an elastic belly band with a holster for her Sig Sauer semiautomatic handgun. It also has pockets to hold two backup magazines. When her friends laid eyes on it, they wanted one too. So she stitched up some of the corset-style holsters and starting selling them in 2014. Fay called her company Miss Concealed. "When I started selling my stuff on eBay (EBAY), it started selling like hotcakes," said Fay, who peddles a lacy line of holstered corsets called Hidden Heat for $30 to $50. "I couldn't keep enough inventory. As soon as I make them, they're right out the door." Fay said she hired seven sewers as revenue swelled to $200,000 in 2015. She made more than half of that in the last three months of the year. She said orders spiked after a mass shooting in San Bernardino killed 14 people in December. "Women want to protect themselves," said Fay. "There's so much craziness going on right now. Men and women don't want to be a victim." Last month, when she was exhibiting her products in Las Vegas at the National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show, she had to temporarily stop taking new orders because her sewers couldn't keep up with demand. Fay wasn't the only woman entrepreneur at the SHOT Show catering to the growing market. Related: Gunmakers streamline pistols for women who carry Self-protection is serious business for Leslie Deets, founder of a gun-centric handbag startup called Concealed Carrie. She and her husband also co-own Sharp Shooters USA gun range in Roswell, Georgia. Being in the gun business "hits close to home," said Deets, as she described a harrowing assault while a college freshman. "He kidnapped me, stabbed me and held me at gunpoint." Deets sells handbags containing hidden holsters for small handguns, like her pink Walther PPK .380 semiautomatic, which she can access in a "crossbody" draw from her purse. She designs her purses, satchels, clutches and compacts to be fashionable as well as utilitarian, providing quick access to concealed guns, TASERs and pepper spray. Related: Guns, guns guns: 2015 was a record year for FBI background checks "We want to enhance your wardrobe, not distract from it," she said. "We don't want everybody to know our business." Prices top out at $229, though she offers free replacements to women who shoot through the bags to protect themselves from assault. Tessa Renaud, an Ob-Gyn from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has also made a business out of self-protection. She got a concealed carry permit when she used to work in the ER because her shift ended in the wee hours and she wanted to be armed when she walked alone to her car. But she didn't know how was she going to holster her bulky Smith & Wesson (SWHC) 1911 semiautomatic pistol and her Ruger (RGR)SP101 revolver. "I looked for weeks and couldn't find the right thing," she said. "I got so frustrated I decided to come up with something on my own." She designed a line of lace flexible wraps that are fastened to the body with metal clips, like Ace bandages. Her booth at the SHOT Show featured a mannequin covered in lace wraps like a mummy, with replica guns strapped to its torso, arms and legs. Related: How the Iron Pipeline funnels guns into cities with tough gun laws Renaud started Lethal Lace about two years ago with her husband, Mike, an ex-sheriff and stay-at-home dad for their six kids. They said they sold 1,000 of the products last year, with revenues totaling $25,000 December alone, which was their best month. The wrap holsters cost $58. At the SHOT Show they launched a new wrap holster for men, sans lace. But the Renauds said they've already sold a lot of lace wraps to men. "I wear the lace one," said Mike. "It's concealed.

The startup just scored a free 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl on February 7. The Super Bowl is the most watched event of the year and is notoriously expensive for advertisers. A 30-second ad during this year's game is expected to cost a record-breaking $5 million. But for Death Wish Coffee, the hefty pricetag is irrelevant. The company beat out 15,000 other small businesses in the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Big Game contest, which gets it an all-expenses-paid ad to air during the Super Bowl. "Winning this commercial is beyond our wildest dreams," said Mike Brown, owner of Death Wish Coffee, based in Round Lake, New York. "It's amazing to think that our 11-employee company will be on the same stage as the brands we've always admired." It's the second time that Intuit has run the contest, which is voted on by the public. In 2013, Goldieblox -- which makes engineering toys for girls -- won. Related: Super Bowl tickets heading for a record Big brands like Budweiser, Doritos and Coca-Cola (KO) typically dominate the ad lineup -- Death Wish Coffee will be the only small business ad to be seen by more than 100 million viewers. It's a big deal for a business that's only four years old. Brown said he was inspired to create an ultra-strong dark roast blend simply because there was demand. "I've had a coffee shop for years and my customers were always asking for stronger coffee," he said. "An average cup of coffee has 217 mg of caffeine. Ours is double that," said Brown. Last year Death Wish Coffee logged $3 million in revenue. The brand has also developed a fanatical fan following. "We have fans who've tattooed our logo on their chest," said Brown. Related: How the Super Bowl will handle millions of selfies Brown said he's excited for Death Wish Coffee to bask in the 30-second spotlight. "We've revamped our website, hired more employees and we're getting ready for it," he said. "We're already in about 100 grocery stores locally. I want everyone in the country and around the world to taste out coffee." As for the ad itself, Brown said it's like a movie trailer.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/28/smallbusiness/silicone-stasher-sandwich-bags/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|Say goodbye to plastic sandwich bags|Kat Nouri has a love-hate relationship with plastic. As an artist and product designer, she's enamored with its transparency and the endless creative uses for it. But as a mother, and an environmentally-conscious consumer, she's disgusted by it. "Plastic is a big part of our daily lives. There's no denying it," said Nouri. "But every time we use more of it , we're harming ourselves and Earth." So she's doing something about it. On Thursday, Nouri unveiled Stasher, a line of sandwich bags made entirely of silicone, a natural material made of sand, rock and oxygen. Related: More plastic than fish in oceans by 2050 Like plastic sandwich bags, the silicone bags feature the same pinch-press, air-tight closure. But the comparisons end there, said Nouri. Her silicone bags are petroleum-free and contain no PVC, latex or phthalates. And while 20 million plastic bags end up in U.S. landfills each day, Stasher bags are reusable for at least three years and can be frozen, microwaved or put in the dishwasher. With dry-erase markers, you can scribble notes and labels directly onto the bag's surface. Not feeling creative? The bags also come in fun designs -- think circus, space and monster themes. Stasher bags will be available online in February and in retail stores in March. Related: She's $10 million closer to replacing plastic bottles Nouri has been on a personal crusade for more than a decade to help consumers replace everyday plastic products with safer silicone-based alternatives. She was partly motivated by her upbringing in Iran. "My father was a champion wrestler and my mother has a PhD in nutrition," she said. "So I was very conscious about health and nutrition growing up." Nouri immigrated to the San Francisco Bay Area when she was 10. "I became somewhat of a rebel," said Nouri. "I was just very creative and wanted to do things my way." After graduating from UC Berkeley, Nouri took a sales and marketing internship at IBM. "But I always had a little business venture on the side," she said. "People would constantly tell me I was a natural entrepreneur." Nouri launched her company Modern Twist in 2005. The company makes silicone-based placemats, coasters and a variety of baby items, including bibs, cups and food containers. "As consumers, we focus more on what we eat," said Nouri, who has three kids. "To me, especially as a mom, it was just as important to evaluate where we are putting our food. I was packing three lunches a day in plastic bags." Today, Modern Twist is profitable, generates about $10 million a year in revenue, and its products are sold in over 4,000 retailers nationwide. Related: No really. This pencil grows into a tomato Nouri said Stasher bags are a natural evolution of her vision for a plastics-free world. She spent three years and $500,000 researching and developing the silicon sandwich bags. "It was a big investment for us at the time and I nearly went broke," she said. The silicone bags (which sell for $12.99 to $14.99 apiece) do cost quite a bit more than a box of disposable plastic bags. Still, she's hopeful that the long-term economic and environmental value of the silicone bags will sway consumers to buy them. In the meantime, Nouri is already planning to expand the Stasher line with other sizes later this year. "I hope that these bags can become a symbol of how we are rethinking plastic and caring for our planet," she said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160125113444-stasher-split-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/22/smallbusiness/safichoo-toilet-jasmine-burton/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|This plastic toilet could save lives|Everybody poops. But not everyone has access to a toilet. "It's shocking that this basic necessity is unavailable to nearly half of the world," said Jasmine Burton, founder and president of Atlanta-based Wish for WASH. Burton, 23, was a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology when she learned that as many as 2.5 billion people don't have access to a toilet. It bothered her even more that this sanitation problem disproportionately affects women and young girls. "Young girls in the developing world frequently drop out of school because there isn't a toilet," she said. "It angered me as a woman in higher education and as a product designer." Just 18 at the time, Burton channeled her feelings into a mission: She would design a toilet. While at Georgia Tech, she collaborated with three other students to invent an inexpensive, eco-friendly mobile toilet that could convert waste into renewable energy. They called their sanitation system SafiChoo Toilet. Related: 5 startups that are reimagining the world Made of plastic, the toilet is designed for sitting or squatting, which is a common practice in some countries. It can be placed directly on the ground, or it can be elevated by adding an attachable base. It can also function with or without water. The system features a waste collection unit (that can go above or below ground), which separates the waste into liquids and solids. There's also a manually-operated bidet that can be attached. Burton said these features are intended to help curb contamination and the spread of diseases. The SafiChoo toilet costs about $50. "That's the highest price point we want it to be," she said Related: These startups are heading to Richard Branson's private island In 2014, Burton and her team won first place and $25,000 at the Georgia Tech InVention competition, the nation's largest undergraduate invention competition. "We didn't think we'd win because products at the contest were always high-tech with super sexy designs," she said. "Ours was a simple toilet." The win enabled Burton to pilot SafiChoo (which means clean toilet in Kiswahili) at a Kenyan refugee camp. She also launched Wish for WASH, the parent company of SafiChoo. Related: She's $10 million closer to replacing plastic bottles John Zegers, director at Georgia Center of Innovation for Manufacturing, contacted Burton after her InVention competition win. "We thought it was a great product that needed a little bit more development," he said.

Zegers said he hopes that Wish for WASH is able to keep the toilet a Made in America product. Burton is currently living in Lusaka, Zambia, as she tests the toilet there. The company is also running an Indiegogo campaign to support the Zambia pilot. She hopes to begin selling the toilet to U.S.-based customers and to NGOs in 2017. "It's amazing when you see how many people have never used a toilet before and what [the SafiChoo Toilet] could mean for them," she said.|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160121115312-jasmine-burton-toilet-grass-780x439.jpg
http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/21/smallbusiness/daymond-john-shark-tank/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|How Shark Tank star made his billions|Daymond John, best known as an investor on ABC's reality series Shark Tank, grew up the only child of a single mother living in Queens, New York. He would often stare out onto the Manhattan skyline at one of the city's primary symbols of success and ambition: The Empire State Building. Today, his company's offices are spread throughout the entire 66th floor of one of New York City's most famous landmarks. "I am a product of this amazing, amazing city," he says of New York. "It toughened me up. It made me battle tested." Before Shark Tank shot him to international fame, John made his fortune as the founder, president and CEO of FUBU, an urban streetwear label championed by hip hop artists. It all started with his mother's sewing machine, and $40 in startup capital. Related: My American Success Story - Daymond John From $40 to $6 billion In the late '80s, John sensed that hip hop would be big. Voices in the black community were speaking up, and John realized he wanted to be a part of the movement. "They were starting to communicate about their hopes, about their dreams, their aspirations, their struggles in the intercity and community. And they were communicating through this music," he recalls. The entrepreneur started designing T-shirts he believed would appeal to young, urban customers like him and his friends. He sewed the garments at night and then hit the sets of music videos, where he pitched rappers to wear his creations on film. During the day, he worked a second job waiting tables at Red Lobster. "'[I would] come home at night, sew shirts, wake up in the morning and deliver the shirts, then go back to Red Lobster, because I had to pay the bills," he says. "But I also wanted to chase this dream, so I had to give up every single thing for it." John's nocturnal sewing sessions ultimately turned into his full-time job. With $40 and three friends, he founded FUBU, an acronym of For Us By Us, eventually growing it into a $6 billion company. Related: How to create a restaurant empire That 'special' feeling: Priceless Over the course of his career, the entrepreneur earned a reputation as a branding guru, working with the Kardashians, rappers LL Cool J and Pit Bull and boxer Lennox Lewis. In 2015, President Obama appointed him as one of nine Presidential Ambassadors of Global Entrepreneurship. One of the reasons John gives back on Shark Tank is he recognizes the value in outside support. "The key to being successful, I believe, is for somebody, or many people, to make you feel special," he says. John values his mother, who worked as a flight attendant for American Airlines, with instilling in him a sense of self-worth that he says helped spur him on through tough times. "I have dyslexia. I didn't know that until 10 years ago. Mom never made me feel like that was anything. She just knew I could excel in math, I could excel in science, and if I had a challenge with reading... try, try harder. Keep trying," he explains. Related: Are celebrity endorsements worth the price? No money = power? Unlike the popular adage that you need to have money to make money, John argues that the lack of it can drive creativity, a theory he laid out in his new book, The Power of Broke. "I realized that almost every single time I have had some level of success, money was never ever a part of it," he says. His entrepreneurial philosophy embraces failure as an essential part of the learning process, something he draws on when deciding which businesses to invest in on Shark Tank. "I like to hear the failures. I want to know that I'm going to work with somebody who tried this, this and this. It didn't work, but this is now working because I don't want my money to be tuition," he says. "And if anybody out there knows entrepreneurship, they know entrepreneurs don't just go 'succeed, succeed, succeed, succeed.' They go 'succeed, succeed, fail, succeed.'"|https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160118160659-damon-john-shark-tank-780x439.jpg

But first you have to move to Ohio.|Ohio has a message for women- and minority-led startups: Move to the Buckeye State and you have a real shot at getting funding. Leading the charge is Cleveland-based JumpStart, a nonprofit that invests in young tech firms. "Part of our focus is to accelerate opportunity for women and minority entrepreneurs in Ohio," said JumpStart CEO Ray Leach. It now wants to expand that mission nationally. JumpStart has launched a $10 million seed fund that will solely invest in women and minority-led tech startups. The Focus Fund will invest in about 20 companies in less than three years -- ideally young companies with five employees or less. JumpStart will also take equity in the startups, although it would not disclose how much. Each startup will get $500,000 in funding. The catch: Entrepreneurs will have to move their headquarters to Ohio to score the money. "We do require them to move Ohio, but they don't have to stay for any particular period of time," said Leach. "Having said this, we believe once they come to Ohio they will not see any need to leave." Related: These three startups are heading to Richard Branson's private island Ohio already has some strong pockets of innovation.

JumpStart, founded in 2005, has invested in 85 early-stage tech firms in Ohio. 35% of those have women or minority founders. That amount of diversity in its funding portfolio is unusual, given that 95% of venture capital funding in the U.S. goes to male-led startups, said Leach, who's also a member of the National Venture Capital Association's diversity and inclusion task force.

JumpStart is moving quickly to find the right firms, and it expects to make the first investment in the next 90 days. "We know there are great innovators who will bring their expertise, talents and relationships to advance Ohio's entrepreneurial economy," said Leach. "It is also our hope that Ohio will be better recognized as one of the most dynamic entrepreneurial states in the country." He also hopes that the Focus Fund will set an example for the VC industry as a whole. "We have a long way to go to embrace diversity in this industry. But you have to start somewhere," he said.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/18/smallbusiness/marijuana-workplaces/index.html?section=money_smbusiness|Take a weed break at work. It's allowed!|At most offices in America, smoking a joint during your lunch break or eating cannabis-laced brownies at your desk would land you in HR. But in some states, not only won't you be punished -- you might be rewarded. Kyle Sherman and Chase Wiseman cofounded Flowhub, which provides software for the cannabis industry, in 2015. The Denver-based startup has been a weed-friendly workplace from day one. "Our philosophy at Flowhub is to get s*** done," said Sherman. "If it helps our employees get work done, then we don't care if they consume at work." Sherman and Chase both consume marijuana at work, either in weekly brainstorming meetings or toward the end of the day. "It definitely surfaces new ideas and a fresh take on things," said Sherman. While recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, smoking of any kind isn't allowed in the building. So Flowhub's 18 employees, most of them millennials, are free to bring in cannabis-infused edibles, sodas and juices. So far, there haven't been any negative outcomes. "Our clients are some of the biggest firms in the cannabis industry," said Sherman. "We have to be on point with our work. We've never had a problem yet." Related: Forget Ohio. Ten more states try to legalize marijuana High There! and MassRoots are just across the street from each other in downtown Denver. Both are social networking platforms for cannabis users. High There! launched 10 months ago and has 150,000 active users. MassRoots, which launched in 2013, models itself as a Facebook (FB) for pot users and expects to cross 1 million users by 4/20. Both startups allow weed at work. "Being in Denver, we're in the heart of the cannabis industry," said Darren Roberts, cofounder of High There! "Cannabis is part of our culture." Still, Roberts said it's not like his employees are constantly stoned at work. Similar to Flowhub, he said consumption typically happens later in the day or at brainstorming sessions. "It has led us to breakthrough moments for our business," he said. "So yes, it's been very effective for us." Related: Pot startups cash in on a wave of legalization MassRoots cofounder Isaac Dietrich schedules weekly rooftop smoke sessions at his apartment building. They're meant for strategic planning and employee bonding. "I thought up MassRoots when I was smoking weed in my college friend's apartment," said Dietrich, whose firm has 30 employees and has raised $4.4 million in funding. "Our general philosophy is that we need to be as productive and creative as possible, everyday," he said. "If cannabis facilitates that, then we're allowing it." While pot-oriented businesses tend to be more open about their consumption, not all companies are eager to talk about it. Many startups fear it could hurt their chances with potential investors. And in states like California, pot is still only legal for medical purposes. Brandon David is a sales executive with a San Francisco-based software firm (he declined to name the company) that has hundreds of customers, including many in the cannabis industry. "It's very well known that most of the employees here consume cannabis regularly during the work day," he said. Related: Should I invest my retirement savings in a marijuana business?

Pot helps him stay focused by managing his stress and anxiety. "Sometimes I get a second wind and I'll put in a few more hours." David said it's an open secret that many more businesses are embracing the notion of consuming pot at work.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/09/americas/lindsay-shiver-bahamas-released/index.html|American woman accused of conspiring to kill her husband released on bail in the Bahamas|Editor’s Note: Lindsay Shiver of Thomasville, Georgia, pleaded not guilty on Friday, Dec. 8, to killing her estranged husband in a Bahamian court during her formal arraignment. CNN — American Lindsay Shiver, accused of conspiring to kill her husband with two co-defendants in the Bahamas, was granted bail of $100,000 by a Bahamian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday. She will be outfitted with an electronic monitoring device and must comply with an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. As Shiver walked into court wearing ripped jeans and a T-shirt, spectators yelled questions but it did not appear she replied to anyone. Shiver must report to the Cable Beach Police Station in Nassau three times per week. She must also not come within 100 feet of her husband, as part of her bail conditions. When Bahamian Supreme Court Justice Cheryl Grant-Thompson finished laying out the conditions of Shiver’s bail, Shiver responded with a soft “OK.” After Shiver picks up her electronic monitoring device, she will be allowed to go to her new residence without returning to jail, her attorney Ian Cargill told CNN on Wednesday. Shiver’s alleged co-conspirators, Terrance Adrian Bethel, 28, and Farron Newbold Jr., 29, had previously been released on $20,000 bail, Cargill told CNN on Friday. Shiver, 36, of Thomasville, Georgia, is accused of unsuccessfully conspiring with the two Bahamas natives to kill her husband, Robert Shiver, on July 16 while on the Abaco Islands, months after the couple filed for divorce. Police in the Bahamas successfully foiled the plot by acting on information found on a phone recovered during a separate criminal inquiry into a recent break-in at a local business, a Bahamian police source told CNN. The defendants were arraigned last month, according to court documents. They were not required to enter pleas at that hearing. Divorce proceedings Lindsay and Robert Shiver had filed for divorce in April, court records indicate. Robert Shiver filed for divorce on April 5, and Lindsay Shiver filed for divorce the following day, according to the complaint listed on the Thomas County, Georgia, Clerk of Courts website. Robert Shiver lists Lindsay’s “adulterous conduct” as a reason for divorce, saying the marriage is irrevocably broken, according to the filings viewed by CNN. The filing from Lindsay Shiver says she has “incurred debt beyond her means to pay,” and asks that her husband be made to pay. Robert Shiver is an insurance executive and former Auburn University football player, court records and his company’s website show. Lindsay Shiver also attended Auburn University, according to social media posts. Lindsay Shiver’s next court appearance is slated for October 5. CNN has reached out to attorneys representing each of them in the divorce case. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the name of Bahamian Supreme Court Justice Cheryl Grant-Thompson.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230809132652-01-lindsay-shiver-court-app-bahamas-080923-grab.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill

Based on research conducted January 2018 to May 2019, the report “highlights patterns of violations directly and indirectly affecting all human rights.” Responding a few days later, Maduro says the report contains manipulations and inaccurate data. March 26, 2020 - The Justice Department announces narco-terrorism and other criminal charges against Maduro and senior leaders from his government. Federal prosecutors in New York’s Southern District, Miami and Washington, DC, allege the officials are the leaders of the so-called Cartel de los Soles and coordinate with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine to the United States. May 4, 2020 - In a live address on state television, Maduro reports that two American “mercenaries” have been apprehended after a failed coup attempt to capture and remove him. He identifies the captured Americans as Luke Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41. He shows what he claims are the US passports and driver’s licenses of the men, along with their ID cards from Silvercorp, a Florida-based security services company. On August 8, the men are sentenced to 20 years in prison. July 24, 2021 - During an interview with Venezuela’s state-run television, Maduro says he is ready to open negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition in August. October 16, 2021 - Venezuela suspends on-going negotiations with the opposition following the Cape Verde extradition of Colombian businessman Alex Saab, alleged financier to Maduro, to the United States on money laundering charges. September 20, 2022 - A new UN report documents the crimes against humanity, including acts of torture committed by the Venezuelan security forces. The report says the orders for the crimes came from Maduro and other high level officials.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211017100330-nicolas-maduro-10-15-2021.jpg?q=x_2,y_536,h_944,w_1678,c_crop/w_800
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/americas/argentina-vote-president-intl-latam/index.html|Argentina presidential election heading to run-off with Massa leading Milei|CNN — The battle to decide who will run crisis-wracked Argentina is heading to a run off vote next month between left wing candidate Sergio Massa and far right libertarian Javier Milei, according to data released by Argentina’s National Electoral Chamber after the first round of voting on Sunday. After polls closed Massa received the highest number of votes – 8,877,325, accounting for 36.33% of the total, data revealed. Milei received 7,373,876 votes – roughly 30.18%. Third place candidate Patricia Bullrich got 23.82% and conceded defeat late Sunday night. Each is vying for the nation’s trust at a moment of widespread disillusionment with the country’s elite and its management of the country. The results have highlighted a strong showing for the government coalition supporting Massa, who is currently Economic Minister as Argentina finds itself in the most serious financial crisis of the last twenty years. Turnout was over 75%, with more than 25 million Argentinians casting their ballots and over 90% of votes had been counted, the election body said. “It has been a model day of Argentine democracy,” Julio Vitobello, general secretary of the presidency, said at a presser on Sunday night. Inflation in Argentina has soared to 138%, Reuters reports, piling pressure on ordinary people trying to manage the cost of living. “It’s so hard. Each day things costs a little more, it’s like always racing against the clock, searching and searching,” Laura Celiz told the news agency last month, she shopped on the outskirts of capital Buenos Aires. “You buy whatever is cheaper in one place and go to the next place and buy something else.” After casting his vote in Buenos Aires on Sunday, current president Alberto Fernández celebrated the nation’s democracy on the social media platform X. “I call on every Argentine to defend it and decide the future of the country at the polls,” he wrote. Bullrich holds up her marked ballot before putting it into the ballot box during primary elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 22, 2023. Gustavo Garello/AP Bullrich, a former security minister, told has CNN en Español that she would let economists run the finance ministry and offer a firm, calm hand at the wheel compared with Milei’s outbursts. Boasting lengthy experience in national politics, she recently has worked to refresh her image to appeal to younger voters, uploading viral challenges to YouTube and making reference in interviews to her relationship with her cousin, singer Fabiana Cantilo.

For his supporters, Milei’s promises of overhaul have been seductive. Milei, a former financial analyst and self-described “anarcho-capitalist” who wields a chainsaw at rallies, has suggested a raft of radical changes: dollarizing Argentina, slashing public subsidies and eliminating the ministries of culture; education; environment; and women, gender, and diversity. To win in the first round of voting, a presidential candidate must obtain more than 45% of all votes or a minimum of 40% and at least a 10-point lead over the second-place candidate.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/americas/amazon-river-lowest-levels-drought-climate-intl/index.html|Amazon rivers fall to lowest levels in 121 years amid a severe drought|Reuters — Rivers in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil fell to their lowest levels in over a century on Monday as a record drought upends the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and damages the jungle ecosystem. The port of Manaus, the region’s most populous city, at the meeting of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, recorded 13.59 meters (44.6 feet) of water on Monday, compared to 17.60 a year ago, according to its website. That is the lowest level since records began in 121 years ago in 1902, passing a previous all-time low set in 2010. Rapidly drying tributaries to the mighty Amazon have left boats stranded, cutting off food and water supplies to remote villages, while high water temperatures are suspected of killing more than 100 endangered river dolphins. After months without rain, rainforest villager Pedro Mendonca was relieved when a Brazilian NGO delivered supplies to his riverside community near Manaus late last week. “We have gone three months without rain here in our community,” said Mendonca, who lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, west of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state. “It is much hotter than past droughts.” Boats and houseboats stranded in a dry area of the Igarape do Taruma stream which flows into the Rio Negro river in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, Oct 16, 2023. Bruno Kelly/Reuters Some areas of the Amazon have seen the least rain from July to September since 1980, according to the Brazilian government disaster alert center, Cemaden. Brazil’s Science Ministry blames the drought on the onset of the El Niño climate phenomenon this year, which is driving extreme weather patterns globally. In a statement earlier this month, the ministry said it expects the drought will last until at least December, when El Niño’s effects are forecast to peak. Underlying El Niño is the long-term trend of global warming, which is leading to more frequent and more intense extreme weather events, like drought and heat. The drought has affected 481,000 people as of Monday, according to the civil defense agency in the state of Amazonas, where Manaus is located. Late last week, workers from Brazilian NGO Fundação Amazônia Sustentável fanned out across the parched region near Manaus to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable villages. The drought has threatened their access to food, drinking water and medicines, which are usually transported by river.

Bruno Kelly/Reuters Nelson Mendonca, a community leader in Santa Helena do Ingles, said some areas are still reachable by canoe, but many boats have not been able to bring supplies along the river, so most goods are arriving by tractors or on foot. “It’s not very good for us, because we’re practically isolated,” he said. Luciana Valentin, who also lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, said she is concerned about the cleanliness of the local water supply after the drought reduced water levels. “Our children are getting diarrhea, vomiting, and often having fever because of the water,” she said.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231017115729-01-amazon-river-drought.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/americas/ecuador-election-gonzalez-noboa-intl-latam/index.html|Noboa, 35, to become Ecuador’s next president following election dominated by spiraling crime|CNN — Center-right candidate Daniel Noboa, the 35-year-old son of a banana tycoon, will become Ecuador’s next president, following an election driven by concerns over rising violence and a worsening security situation in the Latin American nation. More than 10 million people have voted in the presidential election, and data from the National Electoral Council of Ecuador (CNE) shows Noboa obtained 52.3% of the votes (4,829,130). His main political rival, leftist candidate and first round front-runner Luisa González, obtained 47.7% of votes (4,404,014), the CNE said. Noboa was a lawmaker before outgoing President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the legislature and called for early elections. The Acción Democrática Nacional party’s candidate, he has pledged to create more work opportunities for the young, bring in more foreign investment, using technology to fight crime, and has suggested several anti-corruption measures including sentences for tax evasion. Speaking to reporters after the result, Noboa thanked his wife, parents, and God for allowing him to serve his country. “I also thank all those people who have been part of a new, young, improbable political project, a political project whose purpose was to give back a smile to the country,” he said. “Starting tomorrow, Daniel Noboa, your president of the republic, starts working.” His rival, González of the Movimiento Revolución Ciudadana party, a protégé of former leftist President Rafael Correa, ran on a promise to enhance public spending and social programs and wants to address the security crisis by fixing the root causes of violence, such as poverty and inequality. González was the frontrunner in the first round of voting. She conceded to Noboa after the result was announced, saying she would congratulate him on his victory. “To the candidate now president-elect, we offer deep congratulations because it’s a democracy; we have never called for a city to be set on fire, we have never come out to shout fraud,” she said. Security was tight throughout Sunday’s vote with tens of thousands of police officers and army personnel stationed at polling stations across the country. Crime remained at the forefront of Ecuador’s run-off vote, months after the high-profile assassination of another presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, who was slain days before the August 20 first-round poll. The killing became a tragic symbol of the country’s worsening security situation, where rival criminal organizations have been meting out brutal and often public shows of violence in the country’s streets and prisons in their battle to control drug trafficking routes. Voter turnout was “historic” at 82.33% despite initial security concerns, CNE president Diana Atamaint said after polls closed Sunday. “The transmission of the results has been fluid and constant; the Ecuadorians have permanently followed the votes obtained by each of the candidates, which are the result of the popular will expressed at the polls,” she Atamaint after the results came out. “We have complied with a historic electoral process. The country gave us this mission, and today, we say to Ecuador and the entire world, ‘task accomplished;’ today democracy won, today Ecuador won.” Tough job ahead Before Ecuador, a nation of nearly 17 million, was transformed into one of the most dangerous countries in the region, it was known as a relatively peaceful place that was nestled between two of the world’s largest narcotics producers, Peru and Colombia. Its deep ports, dollarized economy, and corruption have since made it a key transit point for drugs making its way to consumers in the US and Europe. The mounting violence, paired with a lack of economic prospects, have also compelled many Ecuadorians to leave the country. “We are not sure [what] will put an end to this because we cannot live with that fear” of crime, small business owner César Ortiz told CNN en Español in Quito ahead of the poll. Ortiz said he hopes the new president will focus not just on security but on the economy because “there are so many people who are unemployed, that is why crime [is] abound.” Whoever wins on Sunday may gain a cursed chalice, say analysts covering the region. “Governing Ecuador right now is hell – this presidency is designed to eliminate you from political life,” Freeman said. The new president will have relatively little time to work on a solution to the country’s woes. They will hold office only until 2025, which would have been the end of Lasso’s term – a short window for even the most seasoned politician to turn things around in the country.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231013213232-ecuador-elecciones.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill

Pedro Barrientos was arrested last week during a traffic stop in Deltona, Florida, ICE announced Tuesday. Barrientos, a former military officer, was charged by a Chilean judge in 2012 in the brutal 1973 killing of Jara. “Barrientos will now have to answer the charges he’s faced with in Chile for his involvement in torture and extrajudicial killing of Chilean citizens,” said John Condon, a special agent with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Tampa division, in a written statement Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Barrientos’ attorneys for comment. Jara, a communist sympathizer, was among the first victims of Chile’s military coup and dictatorship in 1973. His body was found with 44 bullet wounds and signs of torture. Chilean singer Victor Jara was tortured and killed during the country's military dictatorship in 1973. Reuters/File “On Sept. 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet led a violent coup against Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president of Chile,” ICE said in its statement. “In the following weeks, many people were detained and tortured in Chile Stadium, an indoor sports facility that the military commandeered as a de facto detention center,” ICE said. “Many disappeared or were executed. Victor Jara, a popular folk musician, was among the most famous victims.” Demonstrators carry a flag with Victor Jara's image during a protest against the Chilean government in January 2020. Marcelo Hernandez/Getty Images Barrientos later came to the US in 1990 and overstayed his visa, according to court documents, but was able to obtain US citizenship after marrying an American. In 2016, a civil jury in Florida ruled that Barrientos was responsible for Jara’s death and found him liable for $28 million in damages to Jara’s surviving family members. This summer, Barrientos’ citizenship was revoked after a judge found that Barrientos had lied in his citizenship application, failing to disclose his connection to Pinochet’s regime.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231011121314-pedro-paulo-barrientos-nunez-arrest.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/americas/amazon-drought-floating-village-climate-intl/index.html|A floating village is stranded on a dry lakebed as extreme drought grips the Amazon|CNN — A floating village now lies stranded on a lakebed in Brazil’s Amazon as severe drought leaves communities struggling to access food, fresh water and fuel. Dramatically receding water levels in Lake Puraquequara, east of Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, have left boats and floating buildings marooned in the mud. It is the latest example of the devastating impacts of heat and drought on this part of Brazil – earlier this month more than a hundred river dolphins washed ashore dead as water temperatures soared – and authorities say the situation is set to get worse. Lake Puraquequara is part of the Rio Negro river system, which has been near record-low since the end of September, according to the state’s civil defense authority. “Declining water levels are having a profound impact,” a spokesperson for the authority told CNN. Some residents have resorted to digging wells in the cracked lakebed in an attempt to reach water. “Our shops have no customers. We are isolated, boats cannot enter or leave the lake,” local resident Isaac Rodrigues told Reuters. “We’re going to be here until God sends us water.” Ivalmir Silva digs a well to obtain water at Lake Puraquequara in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil, on October 6, 2023. Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images The severe drought extends across the state. Forty-two municipalities of the 62 in the state were in an emergency situation with more than 300,000 people affected, the civil defense authority told CNN Monday. And the situation is expected to get worse. Around 500,000 people and 50 municipalities are likely to be affected over the next several weeks, “since we are still predicting a few months with reduced rain levels,” the spokesperson for the state authority said. In late September, Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima declared a state of emergency and announced a package of assistance measures, including providing food to those most affected by the drought. “There are many people already having difficulty accessing food, food security, drinking water and other important inputs,” he said in a statement at the time. Boats and houseboats stranded on Lake Puraquequara in Manaus, Brazil, October 6, 2023. Bruno Kelly/Reuters The drought is also devastating wildlife in the state’s rivers. Scientists believe the unusual deaths of more than 100 dolphins in Lake Tefé, west of Manaus, at the beginning of October may be linked to the searingly high water temperatures. “It’s still early to determine the cause of this extreme event but according to our experts, it is certainly connected to the drought period and high temperatures in Lake Tefé, in which some points are exceeding 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit),” the institute said in comments carried by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.

Three children and two women are among the victims, all of whom are from Venezuela and Haiti, the Oaxaca state attorney general said. At least 27 people were injured and transported to nearby hospitals. Pictures posted by authorities on Facebook show the large bus flipped over and heavily damaged on a curve of the mountainous Oaxaca-Cuacnopalan highway. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which took place at 5 a.m. local time (7 a.m. ET).

Venezuela and Haiti are sources of large numbers of migrants traveling northward, fleeing insecurity and economic crisis at home. US and Mexican officials have struggled to respond to the arrivals, with Washington putting increasing pressure on Mexico City to shoulder more responsibility for people crossing its territory. Food shortages and limited access to health care have driven more than 7.7 million people from Venezuela alone – a scale of displacement that outpaces Ukraine, where there’s an active war. On Thursday, senior officials in the Biden administration said the US would restart deporting Venezuelans directly to Venezuela in an attempt to curb the record influx, marking a major shift in policy.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/americas/venezuela-juan-guaido-arrest-warrant-intl-hnk/index.html|Venezuela issues arrest warrant for US-based opposition leader Juan Guaido|Bogota CNN — Venezuelan authorities on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader and former interim president Juan Guaido, who dismissed the move as politically motivated. During a press conference in the capital Caracas, Attorney General Tarek William Saab alleged that Guaido had used the state-owned oil company PDVSA’s resources to finance himself and pay his legal expenses. “Juan Guaido used PDVSA resources to finance himself, pay his legal expenses, and forced PDVSA to accept his financing terms. These decisions caused losses to the nation of $19 billion, resulting in the almost definitive loss of Citgo,” Saab said, adding that Venezuela will request a red notice from Interpol. “For this reason, we have opened a new investigation against former deputy Juan Guaido, and we have requested an arrest warrant against him,” he said. Guaido served as the interim president of Venezuela’s transitional government from 2019 until late 2022 – when he was ousted from his leadership role after struggling to make significant gains against the authoritarian regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. This spring, Guaido traveled to Miami, where he has remained. Speaking to CNN on Friday, he said, “Of course, I want to be back in Venezuela, but at least here I am alive and free, which is not the same for many Venezuelans who are behind bars or have been murdered by the dictatorship.” The allegations Saab said the arrest warrant against Guaido will be for the alleged crimes of treason; usurpation of functions; profit or extraction of money, securities and public goods; money laundering; and association. He also said that least 28 investigations are ongoing in the country against Guaido for a raft of alleged crimes including usurpation of functions, money laundering, terrorism, arms trafficking, and treason. “Those who at some point believed in this guy and went out to march; they see that they found it to be a vulgar criminal of the worst caliber, robbing and kidnapping,” Saab said. Guaido’s spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations, but during a live transmission on his Instagram account, Guaido described them as “false” and challenged President Maduro to submit to justice himself. “This message goes to you, Maduro, tomorrow let’s meet at any prosecutor’s office in the US or, if you prefer, another jurisdiction, The Hague. We can then go directly to the jurisdiction that also points (to) you directly,” Guaido said. In June, the International Criminal Court ruled that prosecutors should resume investigating alleged crimes against humanity in Venezuela by security forces under President Maduro. “The question is, why now? Why did the dictatorship not do it before?” he said of the arrest warrant. “So no, Maduro, I did not allow you to kidnap me, I will not allow you to take away my voice, and I will continue to denounce you in all places where possible, as a criminal.” An upcoming vote Venezuela is due to hold a presidential vote in 2024, though critics have cast doubt on whether elections can be free and fair in the country’s repressive political climate. Guaido called on his followers to vote in the upcoming opposition primary election on October 22, saying, “today the vote is kidnapped in Venezuela, but we have an opportunity to mobilize again to confront Nicolas Maduro.” The US, which had long been a supporter of Guaido, has somewhat softened its stance toward Caracas as the region struggles with rising energy costs and hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants. On Thursday, senior officials in the Biden administration said the US will restart deporting Venezuelans directly to Venezuela in an attempt to curb the record influx of crossings at the US-Mexico border, marking a major shift in policy. Venezuelans who cross the US-Mexico border unlawfully and lack a legal basis to remain in the US will be eligible for removal, the senior administration officials said, adding that Venezuela had agreed to accept back its nationals. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the new policy “a key piece” of the administration’s approach to migration. Advocacy groups however have slammed the shift as dangerous for deportees; the policy will “likely lead to unsafe returns,” Refugees International warned in a statement. In his interview with CNN on Friday, Guaido said he didn’t believe that the deportation deal was connected to his arrest. However, he did say that it underlined Maduro’s interest in gaining international recognition as Venezuela’s head of state. “They are not going to stop the migration situation just by stopping migration or connect flights. We need to put a stop to the regime and recover rights in Venezuela,” Guaidó said. “The only thing Maduro is looking for is recognition, and even with these deportation flights, he’s going to spin them as de facto recognition for his regime. That’s what he gets from this,” he continued. “We never expected that Venezuelan migrants would reach the US directly, on foot, from Venezuela. Those are thousands of miles of desperation through the jungle. But we need to change the situation in Venezuela, bringing the country back to democracy, if we want to solve the migration crisis.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231005213543-juan-guaido-file-100523.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/americas/california-mexico-border-school-migrants-cnnheroes/index.html|For hundreds of migrant children living in shelters at the border, this CNN Hero’s mobile classrooms offer education and stability|Tijuana, Mexico CNN — Estefanía Rebellón knows the trauma that stems from being forced to flee your home for safety. She understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too. “My family’s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border. It was never a choice for our family to leave our home. We were forced out of it,” Rebellón, 32, said. She was 10 when her family fled Cali, Colombia, because of death threats to her father, who had been forced into hiding. They settled in Miami, and with the support of teachers at school, Rebellón thrived. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the US-Mexico border. Rebellón moved from Miami to Los Angeles when she was 21 to pursue an acting career. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana that she put her career on hold. “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. “I couldn’t forget about what I had just seen. And I was like, ‘I literally have to go back.’” Rebellón and her partner, Kyle Schmidt, used about $1,000 of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border. They enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps. “We set up a school overnight and … told just a couple of kids,” Rebellón said. “It spread throughout the camp, and we had like over 50 kids surrounding us.” Transforming a bus into a classroom In the months that followed, when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters, Rebellón and Schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services. “I thought, “Why don’t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom, and we could take it to all the different shelters?” Rebellón said. “We literally just Googled and YouTubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom.” Over the next year, Rebellón and Schmidt bought and gutted a bus, partnered with shelters, and drove the transformed bus over the border. Their goal: to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school. “All the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum,” Rebellón said. “They’re going through all the processes that are being required of them.” Rebellón’s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student. The program has been accredited by the education secretary in Mexico and serves children ages 3 to 15 – a crucial period for education, Rebellón says. Since 2019, CNN Hero Estefanía Rebellón and her organization have provided school programs and stability for thousands of children living in limbo. Allie Torgan/CNN Despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child, she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way. Many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time. Many have been on the road for months, if not years, and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit, without a permanent home. Safety, economic instability, poverty, lack of transportation, and perceived legal status are also factors. “People don’t realize that this is such a long process for families,” Rebellón said. “It’s not just like you arrive at the border, you seek asylum, and your life is all rainbows. It takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain.” Never forgetting her family’s journey Rebellón’s family navigated a decades-long legal process to obtain political asylum and later US citizenship. Her parents, both lawyers by trade, were forced to abandon their careers in Colombia and take on new jobs in the US to support their family of five. Her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at Walmart. He has worked there full time for nearly 20 years. “Any time I get a chance, I share my immigration story with (the kids),” Rebellón said. “I always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of.” Rebellón's program runs all year and serves children ages 3 to 15, with curriculum tailored to their needs. Allie Torgan/CNN Today, Yes We Can Foundation educates 250-300 kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children from 10 countries. Their program runs Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. School runs for the entire year, with no summer breaks. They also provide free uniforms, backpacks, and school supplies.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/americas/mexico-us-amlo-immigration-intl-latam/index.html|As Mexico cracks down on migrants, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador gains leverage with Washington|Mexico City CNN — Last month, as the Biden administration scrambled to manage the latest wave of migrants overwhelming the US southern border, top US immigration authorities crossed into Mexico for an emergency meeting. Seated around a Ciudad Juárez conference room, the officials and their Mexican counterparts drafted a 15-point plan to help defuse the flashpoint – most of it a checklist of actions for the Mexican government. Notably, according to a readout from Mexico’s federal immigration agency, Mexico agreed to carry out more costly deportations of the migrants gathering on their side of the border – a move that some believed would dissuade disorderly crossings. The measures, which also specified Mexican efforts to clamp down on the crush of migrants riding north on railcars, are the latest in a series of policy shifts in Mexico that have alleviated, if slightly, the massive political headache in Washington caused perennially by migration. Analysts in both countries see a pragmatic bargain: as Mexico increasingly carries the weight of US immigration strategy, the Biden administration has granted rare leeway to the country’s divisive but popular leader. “Mexico has real leverage in the relationship with the US. And right now that leverage is around migration,” said Andrew Selee, the president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Members of the Mexican National Guard stand on the border between Mexico and Guatemala to prevent the crossing of migrant caravans on October 21, 2022. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images Sharing nearly 2,000 miles of land border and a history of important economic exchange, Mexico and the US have long held intertwined immigration policies that adapted as international migration patterns shifted. When George W. Bush made his first trip out of the US as president in 2001, it was to the ranch of Vicente Fox, the Mexican leader, to discuss a new era of cooperation on border issues, like trade, drugs, and the northward flow of Mexicans, who at that time comprised the bulk of undocumented border-crossers. But as spiraling violence and desperate economic conditions fueled years of mass migration out of Central America and the Caribbean to the US, overpowering the country’s legal intake system, the stretch of Mexican territory in between became a critical “buffer state,” said Maureen Meyer of the Washington Office on Latin America. “The Mexico southern border pretty much was the US southern border,” Meyer said. Under pressure from several US administrations, Mexico has repeatedly sent resources to its border with Guatemala over the past 10 years to formalize migration routes and detained record numbers of migrants at newly installed checkpoints as they made their way north. At the helm of Mexico’s latest immigration coordination with the US has been President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist leader who in 2018 campaigned on resistance to doing the US’s “dirty work” on migration. His political calculus has changed swiftly since then. Crossing ‘another line’ in immigration enforcement Under the threat of crippling tariffs from then-President Donald Trump, López Obrador agreed in 2019 to allow asylum applicants to wait out their claims inside Mexico under the “Remain in Mexico” policy, roiling activists who said it forced migrants into dangerous living conditions. During the pandemic, when the US employed a public health measure known as Title 42 to turn around many asylum seekers at the border, López Obrador agreed to receive many of the migrants, reversing a long-standing position in the country and straining the resources of Mexico’s own border cities. In May, as the US ended the use of Title 42, López Obrador continued to allow the returns on “humanitarian grounds.” “I think these more recent steps really do cross another line because it is not just stopping people from coming to the United States, which has been the more enforcer role,” Meyer said. “It is actually allowing people deported from the United States to either stay in Mexico, or in this case now, actually maybe actively returning them back to their home countries for the United States,” she said. Details on the deportation plan announced last month have been limited. In a news conference from Washington on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena said that Mexican authorities were carrying out six flights each week to return migrants to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Bárcena added that officials were “exploring” the possibility of expanding the returns to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. It was unclear where the deportation flights were taking place and when they had begun. It also couldn’t be learned if the migrants being returned had already been deported from the US or if they had pending asylum claims. Stakeholders in Mexico told CNN last week that there had not appeared to be any significant change in the pace of repatriation flights in the country’s north. A spokeswoman for Mexico’s federal immigration agency declined to provide more details on the deportations. But the announcement may already have had the effect of discouraging migrants from crossing to the US without the appointment required to seek an asylum claim. In the weekend that followed the meeting, the number of migrants encountered by border authorities entering the US near El Paso, Texas, fell by about 30%, CNN has reported. Last Wednesday, López Obrador also announced that he was planning a summit with officials from several Latin American and Caribbean countries “whose populations are migrating” to be held in the coming days. Mexico also last month agreed to urge countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba — which have limited diplomatic relations with the US — to take back their citizens deported at the border. “What we are looking for is to reach an agreement to confront the migration phenomenon by addressing the causes,” López Obrador said at a news conference. “We have to align ourselves.” An uptick in shuttle diplomacy The recent cooperation between the two countries has come with a busy schedule of shuttle diplomacy. Last week, Bárcena held meetings in Washington with Senate leaders and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Biden’s homeland security advisor. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Mexico this week along with other cabinet secretaries and meet with López Obrador. For Mexican negotiators, the country’s increased responsibilities have often been conditioned on a US commitment to grow the ways that migrants can enter the country legally, like through temporary work visas and a recently expanded humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration says has allowed tens of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who meet certain conditions, including a local sponsor in the US, to fly into the country and secure work authorization. Last month, ahead of the announcement around Mexican deportations, Mexico’s foreign minister told Bloomberg in an interview that the US and Mexico were nearing an agreement with the United Nations to pre-screen tens of thousands of migrants in Mexico for entry into the US under the parole programs. The US has opened similar processing centers in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson told CNN that the organization is “regularly in contact with US and Mexican authorities including on how we can provide support to possible future initiatives.” “Politically for the Mexican government, they can’t do enhanced enforcement without showing that they are also fighting for the well-being of migrants and for legal opportunities, because it is a country with a history of migration to the United States,” Selee said. A free hand for Lopez Obrador? Still, some analysts see a more cynical incentive behind the cooperation, arguing that the Biden administration has largely turned a blind eye to elements of López Obrador’s agenda that would have typically drawn rebuke. “López Obrador very quickly understood that if he gave into Biden’s request for support he would have significant political capital to ensure that US pressure on a number of either bilateral issues or domestic Mexican policy issues would be constrained,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington who has been a critic of the current administration. Detractors point to democratic backsliding in a number of López Obrador’s positions: an attempted reform of the country’s independent election authority, frequent criticism of the judiciary and the press, and the capitulation of state powers on policing and transportation to the military. The election reform, which was passed earlier this year but later blocked by the Mexican Supreme Court, diminished the country’s independent election authority, cutting its workforce across the country and limiting its autonomy ahead of a presidential vote next year. Tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the capital against the policy in the largest opposition protest of López Obrador’s presidency. Critics decried it as a dangerous erosion of democratic institutions. But in Washington, the Biden administration was unusually muted. In a statement following the February protests, Ned Price, a senior adviser to Blinken, described “a great debate on electoral reforms on the independence of electoral and judicial institutions that illustrates Mexico’s vibrant democracy.” “We respect Mexico’s sovereignty. We believe that a well-resourced, independent electoral system and respect for judicial independence support healthy democracy,” Price said. If Mexico had less leverage in its relationship with the US, “I think that you’d see greater public pressure from the State Department, from the White House, on the slippery slope of democratic erosion that we’re seeing in Mexico,” Sarukhán said. “I think the United States should be invested in Mexico’s democratic strength because if not, what you’ll have in Washington sooner or later is someone asking the question, ‘Who lost Mexico and why?’” he added.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231004161234-02-migrants-mx-amlo.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/americas/mexico-presidential-election-sheinbaum-galvez-intl-latam/index.html|The women vying to become Mexico’s next president|CNN — The governing party called it a ceremonial passing of the baton. But the opposition lambasted it as a “passing of the scepter.” Constitutionally barred from running for reelection, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sought to show last month, in a very public way, that presidential candidate Claudia Sheinbaum has his blessing. So he handed his hoped-for successor an actual baton, in a ceremony outside a Mexico City restaurant not far from the National Palace – the seat of the country’s executive power. Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old former Mexico City mayor and longtime political ally of Lopez Obrador, hit all the right notes in thanking him. Accepting the baton along with the leftist Morena party’s presidential nomination, Sheinbaum said she would assume “the full responsibility of continuing the course marked by our people, that of the transformation initiated by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.” When Mexicans go to the polls next June, they will choose between two women for president – a first in the country’s history. Only four days before Morena nominated Sheinbaum, Mexico’s opposition coalition Broad Front chose another formidable female candidate, former senator Xochitl Gálvez from the conservative PAN party. It’s not the first time Mexico sees women running for the presidency; before Sheinbaum and Gálvez, were six other female presidential candidates. But with the two major political sides nominating women, this is the first time that it’s practically a given that starting in December 2024, Mexico, a country previously known for machismo, will be run by a woman. Still, some critics say the outgoing Lopez Obrador’s shadow looms over the contest. Claudia Sheinbaum, left, and Xochitl Galvez Getty Images Gálvez’s rise in Mexican politics has been meteoric; this spring, she said she wasn’t even the favorite of the PRI, PAN and PRD, the parties that now form the Broad Front coalition. It was a public spat with Lopez Obrador himself – who regularly attacked her as a “wimp,” “puppet,” and “employee of the oligarchy” in news conferences – that ultimately rocketed her into the spotlight. In June, Gálvez went viral when she attempted to enter the National Palace with a judicial order that granted her the right to reply to the president, after successfully suing López Obrador. “This is not a show,” she told reporters at the doors of the National Palace. “The law is the law, period.” The daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother, Gálvez served as the top official for indigenous affairs under former President Vicente Fox before becoming a senator. Unfiltered and irreverent, she described herself in an interview with CNN en Español as “an all-terrain, 4-by-4, kind of woman.” In some respects, she appears progressive. Gálvez has advocated in the Mexican Congress for the rights and welfare of indigenous groups and Afro-Mexicans, and in a regional forum earlier this year in Monterrey, said that oil-rich Mexico should shift to renewable energy. “We haven’t done it because we are dumbasses,” Gálvez unapologetically said. She has also said leftist Lopez Obrador’s pension for all senior citizens should continue, and proposes what she calls a “universal social protection system” of welfare programs for a large portion of the middle and lower classes. But when it comes to security and the fight against organized crime, Gálvez’s three-pronged plan is muscular, based on what she describes as “intelligence, heart and a firm-hand”: strengthening local and state police and giving them access to intelligence, advocating for and protecting victims, and respecting the rule of law. Macario Schettino, a political analyst and Social Science professor at ITESM, a renowned Mexican university, describes Gálvez’s political momentum as impressive, considering that only a few months ago, she wasn’t even considered a candidate with a national profile. “She barely begun to register in political terms, and she’s already had great growth. Many people in Mexico still don’t know her. She is going to grow [..] in popularity,” Schettino said, “While Claudia Sheinbaum can no longer move from where she is because she is already known by most Mexicans.” Sheinbaum, a physicist with a doctorate in environmental engineering, would also be the first president with Jewish heritage if she wins, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. She is currently ahead in most polls, and will be a formidable opponent to beat. Not only does Sheinbaum have the full support of the governing party, she has also long enjoyed the spotlight as mayor of Mexico’s most important city for the last five years until her resignation in June to run for the presidency. On policy, Sheinbaum has vowed to continue many of Lopez Obrador’s policies and programs, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners. But the high-profile ex-mayor rejects criticism of her close political alignment with the president. “Of course we’re not a copy (of the president),” she said in July. Still, she does not shy away from touting the principles they share: “For everybody’s good, let’s put the poor first. There cannot be a rich government if the people are poor. Power is only a virtue when it’s used to serve the people,” Sheinbaum said, repeating the same campaign slogans Lopez Obrador has used for years. Lopez Obrador promises to ‘retire completely’ Schettino believes the immensely popularly Lopez Obrador views Sheinbaum as his extension in power. He points to their party Morena’s roots in the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico for more than seven decades until 2000, which came to be known as “The Dinosaur,” and the Party of Democratic Revolution that branched off from it. In 2012, Lopez Obrador created Morena as a political party. Schettino describes the party today as a “tyrannosaurus” under Lopez Obrador’s influence – representing what he says is the current leader’s desire for a successor to hew closely to his own agenda. “President López Obrador, a dinosaur who not only is a dinosaur, but also has the vocation of a tyrant. He doesn’t want to go. He wants to stay in power,” Schettino said. “I believe that he built Claudia’s candidacy,” Schettino said. López Obrador however has repeatedly dismissed accusations of authoritarian leanings or that he favors a candidate he will be able to control. Earlier this year, Lopez Obrador denied he had any favorites among his party’s hopefuls or that he was pushing for one candidate or another behind the scenes. He has also said that he is going “retire completely” after his six-year term in office comes to an end. “I am retiring, I will not participate in any public event again, of course. I am not going to accept any position, I do not want to be anyone’s advisor, much less am I going to act as a chief. I am not going to have relations with politicians. I am not going to talk about politics,” the president told press in February.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231003175146-claudia-sheinbaum-and-xochitl-galvez-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill

These are the people who have been displaced|Giles Clarke has never seen the gang violence this bad in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital and main port. "Gangs now control some 75% of the city," said Clarke, a New York-based photojournalist who has been visiting the Caribbean country on and off since 2011. "The streets I used to walk are now barricaded with burnt-out vehicles as entire neighborhoods desperately try to protect themselves from gang-led abductions and attacks." Warring gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, choking off vital supply lines to the rest of the country. Gang members have also terrorized the metropolitan population, forcing some 200,000 people to flee their homes amid waves of indiscriminate killing, kidnapping, arson and rape. Clarke was in Port-au-Prince recently and photographed the overcrowded displacement settlements that have sprung up all over the area. These are in schools, churches, former theaters and even boxing gyms. "I was there when school was supposed to be starting for the new year, but instead, many are now overrun by families in tents who sleep on the floors of the classrooms," Clarke said. "Mothers hold hungry babies as the NGOs rush to provide basic needs such as clean water, baby formula and a daily meal if outside security allows access. Many of those I met complain about being unable to access clean water or medicine."

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/americas/un-approves-haiti-military-mission-intl/index.html|UN Security Council approves sending foreign forces to Haiti|CNN — The United Nations Security Council has greenlit the deployment of an armed multinational force to Haiti, as the Caribbean nation wrestles with rampant gang violence and political paralysis. The decision follows repeated calls for military assistance by Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the United States have also strongly urged the international community to back such a mission. Thirteen members of the council voted in favor of the resolution, with Russia and China abstaining. Though approved by the powerful UN Security Council, the force would not formally be under UN control. It is expected to be led by Kenya, which has pledged 1000 police to spearhead the mission. Several of Haiti’s Caribbean neighbors – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica – have also offered support to the mission. The “multinational security support” force will have a 12-month mandate in Haiti. The timing of its arrival is not set yet and more countries have been invited to participate. The resolution also calls for a global stop to arms sales to Haiti, except for approved security purposes. An adviser to Haitian Prime Minister Henry, Jean-Junior Joseph, told CNN that the government welcomed the vote, adding, “We await with impatience the mission to combat general insecurity.” Warring gangs control much of Port-au-Prince – Haiti’s capital city and main port – choking off vital supply lines to the rest of the country. Gang members have also terrorized the metropolitan population, forcing some 200,000 people to flee their homes amid waves of indiscriminate killing, kidnapping, arson and rape. The mission is expected to strengthen local security and to reinforce the Haitian National Police in its pursuit of the gangs. Haiti’s security forces already receive some international support but remain understaffed and outgunned. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 22, Prime Minister Henry told fellow nations that it was “urgent” that the Security Council approve a military mission to reestablish order. Violence has exacerbated broader instability across the country, Henry said, noting that inflation has soared past 50%, leaving 4.9 million Haitians struggling to eat – a dismal new record for the country. In a statement the same day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the international community to support the plan and to provide assistance, including personnel, and said Washington was ready to provide “robust” financial and logistical assistance. The Security Council has found itself in repeated deadlock in recent years amid deepening geopolitical rivalries. A statement by the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, described Monday’s decision on Haiti as “historic” and said the mission “speaks to the UN’s ability to galvanize collective action.” Speaking in the Security Council after the vote, China’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun said his country had “a cautious and responsible approach” toward authorizing the use of force – but that in the case of Haiti, China’s abstention represented a “constructive position” toward the resolution. Russia’s UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia criticized the move in remarks to the council, saying “that sending the armed forces of another state to any country even upon its request is an extreme measure that must be thoroughly thought through,” but noted “some positive elements” to the approved resolution. Both Russia and China expressed approval of the resolution’s arms embargo. Critics of the mission have previously pointed to scandals associated with UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti, including allegations of sexual abuse and the introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic, which killed nearly 10,000 people. Some Haitians also question the mandate of Prime Minister Henry, who took leadership of the country after President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021. Henry has said that Haiti’s long-overdue elections cannot be held until the country reaches a basic level of security. The United Nations’ special representative in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, said her office would support the mission “within the limits of its mandate,” while emphasizing that “unlike recent international missions deployed in Haiti, the MSS mission is not a UN mission.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230802141549-01-haiti-unrest-042523-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill

Rescuers were first alerted to the incident around 8 p.m. Friday after receiving “an alert from an inReach/GPS device indicating a bear attack,” the national park said in a statement. The alert said the incident happened in the Red Deer River Valley area of the park, which is in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. “Parks Canada immediately mobilized a Wildlife Human Attack Response Team whose members are specially trained in responding to wildlife attacks,” Banff National Park said in the statement. “Weather conditions at the time did not allow for helicopter use, and the response team travelled through the night to the location by ground.” The response team arrived at the site around 1 a.m. Saturday and found two people dead and a grizzly bear displaying aggressive behavior, the statement said. Parks Canada staff euthanized the bear “to ensure public safety,” and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrived at the scene to assist in transporting the victims to Sundre, Alberta, about 75 miles northwest of Calgary, officials said. “This is a tragic incident, and Parks Canada wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims,” the statement said. The deadly suspected grizzly attack in Canada happened just weeks a grizzly bear linked to the death of a woman in July near West Yellowstone was euthanized in Montana after breaking into a home through a window with a cub and taking a container of dog food. In 2020, the same bear was also involved in an encounter that injured a person near Henrys Lake State Park in Idaho, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks said in a news release. The male cub who was near the adult grizzly was captured and was being held in Helena at the agency’s wildlife rehabilitation center before it was set to be transferred to a zoo, officials said. And last month, portions of Custer Gallatin National Forest near Big Sky, Montana, were closed after a person was attacked by a grizzly bear while hunting, officials said. Banff National Park, Canada’s first national park, is a popular attraction for tourists, known for its picturesque turquoise waters. Parks Canada notes the park is “home to hundreds of species, including grizzly bears, wolves, elk and more.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231002093542-01-banff-national-park-052323-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/americas/mexico-migrant-children-culver/index.html|They should be in elementary school, instead they speak like war veterans|Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico CNN — The smell of burning wood and plastic hits us as we step out of the van. Smoke from campfires meets the cloud of dirt kicked up by our tires, stinging our eyes and leaving a scratch in our throats. In the near distance, you can hear children splashing and playing in the Suchiate River, which separates Mexico – where we are – from Guatemala. We head toward the murky brown water, walking under tall, thick trees shielding us from the day’s brutal sun. We’re mindful of where we step, dodging scraps of cardboard used for beds and ducking under clothes hanging out to dry, careful not to intrude on someone’s personal space or modest belongings. It strangely feels more like a community rooted here for centuries, rather than a migrants’ campground. And after the assault on the senses, comes the assault on the mind and the heart. Stories abound from the people here, most originally from Venezuela, of why they left their homes and what they’ve gone through so far on their journeys to Ciudad Hidalgo. The adults sometimes become emotional but more shocking is the calm, matter-of-fact, narration from the children. They had seen many dead people in the treacherous muddy jungle passage of the Darién Gap from Colombia to Panama, a group of young cousins tells me. “I saw a woman, she had yellow hair and this part of her face was covered in blood,” says 9-year-old Mathias, gesturing to his right cheek. I catch myself mid-interpretation from Spanish to English, realizing I am talking to children between the ages of 6 and 12 as they describe in vivid detail what they’ve experienced along the way. Joandry, 6, center holds the microphone while his sister Sofia, 12, and cousin Mathias, 9, talk to CNN's David Culver in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on the banks of the Suchiate River. David von Blohn/CNN “You get desperate in the jungle, you think you’re going to die in there,” Mathias says. His 12-year-old cousin Sofia adds: “We ran out of food. We were starving for a night. … We all lost weight.” Her little brother Joandry lifts his shirt to show us his belly, as if to corroborate his sister and cousin’s accounts. “It was hell,” Sofia says. “And every time you saw the end of the road, there was more to walk and we saw some dead people … lying on the ground.” “It was hell,” 6-year-old Joandry corroborates again, looking at me with eyes that have seen far more than most adults. Bonded by experience, where they’ve been and their hopes The trauma from the trek they’ve endured already, mixed with the shared dreams of making it to the United States, bond many of the people on the banks of the Suchiate, especially the kids. Sofia was the first to get our attention as she asks confidently and curiously what we’re doing here. We tell her we’re journalists. Her attention shifts to the water, and she excitedly points out to the river and one of the many rafts. “That’s my dad!” she tells us proudly. “He’s helping others come across.” A few feet away, sitting on the ground and leaning up against a tree is Sofia’s mom, Susana. She’s holding her 2-year-old son as Sofia’s other younger siblings play close by. At first, Susana is more reserved – nodding for Sofia to answer our questions instead of her. But slowly she starts to open up, seemingly wanting to share their story. Susana watches her children in a makeshift encampment in Ciudad Hidalgo. Her family is trying to earn some money before continuing north towards the United States. David von Blohn/CNN Still in conversation with Sofia and Susana, I sit down on a concrete step under an open-air structure used for storing goods that are illegally moved across the river from Mexico to Guatemala. Sofia sits next to me as we look out to the armada of rafts going back and forth, with dozens more chained up and ready to deploy. They’re made of two large black inner tubes, tied together with rope and planks of wood across them to support goods and people. Sofia’s dad, Jeandry, is one of the men who – like a gondolier on the canals of Venice – stands on the back with a long piece of wood steering the raft. At any given time, you can see across the river to Guatemala as up to a couple dozen migrants pile onboard and make the roughly 8-minute trip, illegally crossing into Mexico. Police are stationed a few hundred feet away, and the official crossing is within eyesight down river, but there’s no enforcement along the border just a near-constant free flow back and forth. Video Ad Feedback Video shows what it's like for migrants crossing into Mexico in pursuit of US 03:58 - Source: CNN Sofia and her family say they took one of the rafts five days earlier. They’ve stayed on the riverbank instead of immediately continuing north to save up money, with Sofia’s dad working the rafts and the family asking for donations in the nearby town. As I pull out a microphone, and my team starts recording with their cameras, Sofia’s siblings, aunt, uncle and cousins – who made the journey with them – crowd around. Little Joandry doesn’t want to miss out and hurries over with shampoo still in his hair, cackling as his older sister tries to clean it out. “We’re thinking about Philadelphia [or] Chicago,” Sofia tells me, when I ask where in the US they’d like to go. Her 9-year-old cousin, Mathias, chimes in, “I’m thinking about New York or Florida.” Their parents look on, smiling as they’d told me moments earlier they had no idea where they’d end up; they just want to claim asylum and enter the US legally. The kids smile too as they talk about their dreams to go to school. Sofia and Mathias want to be doctors, though Mathias might also want to be a lawyer, he tells me. When I ask what it’s been like traveling as a family, their faces turn expressionless for a moment. Solemn blank stares. A difference in tone The families have been on the road for nearly two months, having left Colombia, where they lived for the past six years. “We had to leave,” Sofia says. “We couldn’t stay poor there because every day we ate the same thing. There were times when we couldn’t eat at all because there was no money.” Before Colombia, the families fled Venezuela, to get away from the corruption and crime. “And a bad economy,” Joandry explains, taking the microphone out of my hand as if taking over the interview. As we talk and film, my team and I recognize a subtle difference in the migrants’ tone here in southern Mexico compared with those who we’ve met on multiple trips to cities bordering the US hundreds of miles farther north.

Looking at the parents’ eyes, I can sense they have heard murmurs of what’s ahead. Loved ones and friends have gone ahead of them and warned of the horrors. But they manage to strike a hopeful tone. “It’s better than what’s behind us,” Mathias’ mom tells us. “We don’t go backwards; we move forward with God’s blessings.” As we thank the children and their parents for their time, Sofia and Mathias excitedly ask if we want to swim with them. “I have to stay dry to work,” I tell them. “OK!” they shout, sprinting toward the water like any other boisterous children, their trauma buried, for now.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/americas/amazon-river-dolphins-dead-temperatures-drought-intl-hnk/index.html|More than 100 dolphins dead in Amazon as water hits 102 degrees Fahrenheit|CNN — More than a hundred dolphins have been found dead in the Brazilian Amazon amid an historic drought and record-high water temperatures that in places have exceeded 102 degrees Fahrenheit. The dead dolphins were all found in Lake Tefé over the past seven days, according to the Mamirauá Institute, a research facility funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Science. The institute said such a high number of deaths was unusual and suggested record-high lake temperatures and an historic drought in the Amazon may have been the cause. The news is likely to add to the concerns of climate scientists over the effects human activity and extreme droughts are having on the region. “It’s still early to determine the cause of this extreme event but according to our experts, it is certainly connected to the drought period and high temperatures in Lake Tefé, in which some points are exceeding 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit),” the institute said in comments carried by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil. The Amazon River, the world’s largest waterway, is currently in the dry season, and several specimens of river fauna are also suffering from record-high temperatures. A severe drought is threatening the Amazon river. Edmar Barros/AP Researchers and activists are trying to rescue surviving dolphins by transferring them from lagoons and ponds in the outskirts to the main body of the river where the water is cooler, reported CNN Brasil, but the operation is not easy due to the remoteness of the area. “Transferring river dolphins to other rivers is not that safe because it’s important to verify if toxins or viruses are present [before releasing the animals into the wild],” André Coelho, a researcher at the Mamiraua Institute, told CNN Brasil. The drought in the Amazon is impacting the economy as well. Below average levels of water have been reported in 59 municipalities in Amazonas State, impeding both transport and fishing activities on the river. Authorities expect even more acute droughts over the next couple of weeks, which could result in further deaths of dolphins, CNN Brasil reported.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230930204341-01-amazon-river-dolphins-dead-drought.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/americas/chainsaw-candidate-argentina-javier-milei-hnk-intl/index.html|The ‘chainsaw’ candidate challenging Argentina’s left and right|CNN — Carried by a wave of shouting supporters and wielding a chainsaw at the open sky, the man of the hour approached center stage. He looked around and angrily screamed “Chainsaw! Chainsaw!” – a war cry quickly picked up by his supporters calling for carnage. All around him, shouts, chants, and traffic horns blasting loud. This was not a WWE wrestling show, but the 2023 presidential race in Argentina where political outsider Javier Milei is the leading candidate. His repeated appearances wielding a chainsaw at campaign stops – as he did at the rally described above in the seaside city of Mar del Plata on September 12 – symbolize promises to drastically cut government expenses, eliminate public subsidies and “break up with the status quo.” Milei, an economist and former political commentator, surprised Argentina’s political scene in August, when he won the largest share of a coalition primary vote that most observers consider indicative of the upcoming presidential contest, set for October 22. Argentine politics have largely been dominated by the same groups for the past 20 years, and Milei represents a new outside force that is aggressively targeting traditional powerbrokers on both sides of the aisle. It’s a familiar tale that draws comparisons to the rise of other far-right stars like former US President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Argentine presidential candidate Javier Milei for La Libertad Avanza coalition gestures next to Carolina Piparo, candidate for Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, during a campaign rally in La Plata, Buenos Aires on September 12. Agustin Marcarian/Reuters Like Bolsonaro, Milei rose to fame at a time of great economic crisis in his country – Argentina’s yearly inflation reached 124% in August, its highest level in over 32 years, and food prices in particular grew 15% from the previous month, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses INDEC. And like Trump, Milei has been able to channel a sentiment of anger towards a political class perceived as distant and ineffective. To the Trumpian slogan, ‘Drain the swamp’, Milei’s supporters shout “¡¡Qué se vayan todos!!” which translates as “May they all leave!” – an expression of fury at politicians from both sides of the spectrum. Argentina’s left is currently in government, following rule by the right from 2015 to 2019. Milei is presenting himself as the candidate of renewal – an offer that clearly struck a chord with people in the primary vote. The question now is whether his strategy will hold through the national vote next month. “I’ll vote for Milei because I think he’ll change things,” says Eduardo Murchio, a taxi driver in Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires. “I’m tired of the same faces, of the same governors […], I am 40 years old and it’s always the same story,” he told Reuters. A worker receives Argentine peso banknotes in a shop in Buenos Aires on Sept. 26, 2023. Milei has proposed dollarizing Argentina. Erica Canepa/Bloomberg/Getty Images What a Milei presidency might look like Milei, who is unmarried and lives with five English mastiffs – one of them named after neoliberal economist Milton Friedman – describes himself as a libertarian and “anarcho-capitalist.” He has promised to slash public subsidies and get rid of the ministries of culture; education; environment; and women, gender, and diversity; among several others. Perhaps Milei’s most significant proposal is to dollarize Argentina, a radical plan that he claims is the ultimate solution to the country’s chronic inflation troubles. Replacing the peso with the US dollar and giving up on a sovereign monetary policy would hardly be a new approach in Latin America, where Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama all use the US dollar – but it is untested in a country as big as Argentina. But Milei’s skill as a macroeconomic strategist is also untested; he worked as financial analyst in the private sector before entering politics. “To open the economy without any protection barrier has never happened in Argentina,” said Javier Marcus, a professor of finance at the Rosario National University in Buenos Aires. While other countries have effectively stabilized prices thanks to dollarization, giving up monetary policy would mean effectively giving up Argentina’s ability to influence its own country’s finances. Marcus points out that dollarizing would further expose Argentina to foreign economic troubles – a significant break with other populist leaders. “That’s a big difference because both Trump and Bolsonaro always talk of putting their country first and supporting local manufacturing,” he says. “But if you look at Milei, you can see he always talk of opening Argentina towards the world.” Much less palatable for many, however, is Milei’s tendency toward extreme personal attacks, often seen as sexist. Once in 2018, responding to a question about economic strategies by local journalist Teresa Fria, Milei shouted: “It’s not that I am a totalitarian. I’m just saying that you are a she-donkey, and you talk of things you don’t know. You just talked like a donkey and what I am doing now is un-donkeying you!” His policies have put him on a collision course with Argentina’s powerful female electorate. On the campaign trail, Milei has said he would call for a referendum to abolish the country’s 2020 constitutional reform that legalized abortion, although constitutional experts interviewed by CNN raised doubts over the legality of such a move. He has also taken political risks with his passion for targeting Pope Francis, even referring to the Pope as “an envoy of Satan” in November 2020 – though Milei has in recent months distanced himself from those views. Argentina remains a profoundly Catholic country with over 60% of the population identifying as Roman Catholic, according to the CIA fact book. While Milei has not personally attacked Pope Francis on the campaign trail, a spokesperson told CNN that, for Milei, “Pope Francis represents sectors that prevent progress in society.” Women from feminist organizations take part in a march in defense of legal abortion in Buenos Aires, on September 28, 2023. Emiliano Lasalvia/AFP/Getty Images Facing off with Patricia Bullrich and Sergio Massa But despite his headline-grabbing rhetoric and shock success in the primary, Milei’s run for president is far from a done deal. Argentinian presidents are elected in a two-round system that favors coalition-building and is designed to keep extremism to the sides. Recent polls show the vote split three ways with Milei slightly ahead of traditional center-right aspirant Patricia Bullrich and leftist Sergio Massa, the current economic minister. Bullrich, a former security minister, told CNN en Español that she would let economists run the finance ministry and offer a firm, calm hand at the wheel compared with Milei’s outbursts. Massa, seen as Milei’s top rival, has been trying to position himself as a more pragmatic voice from the left compared to the current government coalition. He has worked to distance himself politically from Argentina’s high-profile vice-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner without alienating her power base. Neither Massa nor Bullrich is expected to deal with Milei at this point in the campaign, and both traditional coalitions were quick to criticize his lack of government experience and the risks of undoing Argentina’s existing economic structures. Pedestrians walk past a campaign poster for Sergio Massa, Argentina's economy minister and presidential candidate of Unity for the Homeland party in Buenos Aires on Sept. 29. Anita Pouchard Serra/Bloomberg/Getty Images Still, experts say there’s a clear appetite for change this year – and that the winning candidate must find a way to capitalize on that. “This election is all about change, even Sergio Massa represents a change within the continuity of government,” said Claudio Jacquelin, the deputy editor of leading Argentinian newspaper La Nación, in an interview with CNN en Español on Wednesday. On Sunday, candidates will hold a first debate with mandatory participation. A first round of voting will follow three weeks later. If no candidate wins 45% of the vote (or more than 40% with a difference greater than 10% with the candidate that follows in vote total), the two highest-placed candidates will proceed to a runoff vote in November. The more competitive run-off after weeks of confrontation and comparison will be Milei’s greatest test. While his surprise ascent has played in his favor so far, the sometimes extreme novelty of his ideas could scare off voters as the race continues, Facundo Nejamkis, director of the polling firm Opina, in Buenos Aires, told CNN. “(Milei’s) challenge — with a view toward the second round — is to prevent fear or uncertainty among the vast majority (of voters), who might end up voting for a candidate they never thought of, just to prevent Milei from getting into power,” he said.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230930221328-01-chainsaw-candidate-argentina-javier-milei.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/americas/united-nations-secretary-general-mia-mottley-intl-latam/index.html|Who could lead the United Nations next? This Caribbean climate leader makes diplomats ‘jump’ with excitement|United Nations CNN — Asked last week if she will run to become the United Nations’ next Secretary General, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados gave a thumbs up, smiled, and walked away. Unofficially, however, UN insiders say she’s a likely front-runner. The 2026 selection process is still far off, but talk of who is best-positioned to win the powerful job has already begun. Historically, there has been a geographical rotation for the position, so it seems likely the next UN leader will be from the Latin America and the Caribbean region – and many advocates say it is time for a female candidate, after 78 years of only male leaders. In the hallways and backrooms of the United Nations headquarters in New York, Mottley is one of several names being floated as likely contenders. Two sources said former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos – a Nobel peace Prize laureate – will launch a campaign soon, though a representative for Santos denies it. Among others, Argentinian diplomat Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is also a recurring name in discussions of who might succeed current UN Secretary-General António Guterres, as are Alicia Bárcena, Mexico’s foreign affairs secretary; Rebeca Grynspan, a high-level UN official and former vice president of Costa Rica; and Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, a former president of the UN General Assembly and former minister of Ecuador. But it is the charismatic and outspoken Mottley whose name often generates the most excitement. Though Mottley has not yet said she will run, one UN diplomat said “I would jump up and down” with excitement if she did. Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a neighboring island, said she would have his vote if she chose to campaign. “I think she would make a great Secretary-General,” he said, “Whatever she does, I will support her.” Video Ad Feedback On GPS: PM of Barbados on paying the bill for climate change 05:01 - Source: CNN Could Mottley run? Mottley became prime minister of Barbados in 2018 and won a second term in a landslide election four years later. Internationally, she has been noticed for cutting her country’s post-colonial ties to the British monarchy, and for her powerful rhetoric on slavery reparations, climate change, and the need to reform global financial institutions through the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral banks. Mottley does not mince her words when it comes to big powers, either. In her address to the General Assembly last week, she asked: “How is it possible for Chevron and the European Union to access the oil and gas of Venezuela, but the people of the Carribean cannot access it at the 35 percent discount offered by the people of Venezuela?” In 2022, Mottley spearheaded the Bridgetown Initiative, a political plan to reform the global financial architecture and development finance to be more equitable, particularly in the face of climate crisis. The initiative would change the way money is loaned to developing countries and set up a special emergency fund for climate disasters. In April, Mottley also joined forces with current UN chief Guterres and announced a revamping of her venture, called Bridgetown 2.0, putting forward six development priorities for development finance that will be discussed on the world stage at the annual meeting of the IMF-World Bank group in October, COP28 in November and the Summit of the Future in 2024. Many diplomats in New York City and outside said they believe in Mottley’s potential to represent issues affecting the developing world as leader of the UN – but also in her capacity to bring her unique style of leadership to the role. ”I don’t think I recall another leader in recent history other than Obama that had the attention of the international community like she does,” a UN diplomat said. Still, some warn that that she is taking political risks. Considering the initiative significantly challenges the status quo for international finance, UN expert Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group says that Mottley has to carefully plan her next steps. Other observers point out that trying to upend existing systems risks angering at least one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, who hold a final word on the Secretary-General selection process. Mottley’s office did not respond to multiple interview requests. Fighting for a woman at the helm The UN’s next Secretary General would take office in January 2027. Is four years too early to start talking about who the next leader of the organization will be? For some, it’s a necessary discussion to have for an institution that is at its turning point, as it grapples with criticism and geopolitical paralysis in the powerful Security Council. “I don’t think it’s early at all,” Elina Valtonen, Finland’s foreign minister, said, “It’s very important to start discussing that because I think it’s also very much a question of what the future should look like for the UN and the Security Council.” Valtonen and others also say that the time for the organization to have its first woman leader was yesterday. “This position should very much be merit-based,” she said, “but I think it’d be very remarkable if again, it’s not a woman who is chosen.” The selection process has long been secretive, but opened up a bit in 2016. To be considered, candidates need to first be nominated by a country, usually their own, and then recommended by the Security Council to the General Assembly. During the last selection process in 2016, a group of countries pledged to only bring forward women candidates – an initiative is currently being revived for the next selection process. In 2016, thirteen candidates ran, seven of whom were women. But Guterres – a Portuguese diplomat long considered the frontrunner for the role – was ultimately elected. “There’s always lots of men that want to run,” said Ben Donaldson, head of campaigns at the United Nations Association of the United Kingdom. This year, he said, “I’m hoping the message is coming through loud and clear from the majority of states and from civil society that no state should be putting forward male candidates. We are all working to increase the stigma around this, hopefully we can nip it in the bud.” Susana Malcorra, a former candidate in the 2016 Secretary General elections, and cofounder and president of advocacy group Global Women Leaders Voices, is also working to make sure the political pressure will bring female candidates forward in the next cycle. “It’s not so much about talking about a Julie or Anne, or Mary, it is more about talking about a Madame Secretary General as a general proposition, and then making sure that we pave the way to get there,” she said. But not everyone agrees with the effort. Dennis Francis, the president of the 78th UN General Assembly who is from Trinidad and Tobago, doesn’t believe men should refrain from running. “I believe that men should run next time around as I believe women should run in their numbers,” he said. “Because what I would want to happen is for a woman to win in those circumstances, not from a field of women. That would be the wrong message.” And with the powerful Security Council is already frozen on a number of issues since the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine its members ultimately finding a consensus on any single candidate. ”All I have to say is grab your popcorn,” Julia Maciel, a diplomat from Paraguay, said.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230929091946-02-mia-amor-mottley-un-0922.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill
https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html|April 3, 2023 Trump indictment news|News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump's arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin. Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom. However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.” Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position. The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.” Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week. The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public. The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.|https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230331140346-donald-trump-230304-super-tease.jpg
